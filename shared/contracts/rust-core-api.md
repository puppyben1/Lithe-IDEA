# Rust Core API

The Rust core is the shared application runtime for macOS SwiftUI and Windows
React/Tauri. macOS calls the stable C ABI while the Tauri host links the Rust
crate directly. The C ABI remains:

```c
const char *lithe_core_version(void);
char *lithe_core_execute_json(const char *request);
char *lithe_core_execute_json_with_events(const char *request, void (*callback)(const char *, void *), void *context);
int32_t lithe_core_git_askpass(const char *prompt);
char *lithe_core_lsp_provider_catalog_json(const char *workspace_root);
int32_t lithe_core_cancel(const char *operation_id);
void lithe_core_free_string(char *value);
void *lithe_agent_open_json(const char *configuration, void (*callback)(const char *, void *), void *context);
int32_t lithe_agent_send_json(void *handle, const char *command);
void lithe_agent_close(void *handle);
```

The macOS package uses the small C bridge in `macos/Sources/LitheRustCore/`. The
canonical C declarations are in `rust/lithe-core/include/lithe_core.h`.
Native clients can link the same `staticlib` or `cdylib`; Rust hosts call
`lithe_core::execute_json` and `lithe_core::cancel_operation` directly. Hosts
call `lithe_core::execution::plan_launch_command` (or the
`execution.planLaunchCommand` JSON command) before spawning a Java process. It
estimates the Windows command-line limit and moves oversized classpath/module-path
options into argument-file text, so macOS can apply the same automatic behavior
without a Windows-only setting. The planner requires a Java executable and a
known JDK feature version of at least 9, obtained through
`java_feature_version_from_release`; other launches remain unchanged. It stops
at the application target (class, JAR, or module), preserving all program arguments.
Core owns the Unicode argument-file text and quoting. The Windows host encodes
that text losslessly using the launcher's actual system code page, independently
of the JDK feature version: JEP 400 does not make native launcher arguments UTF-8.
An unrepresentable path is reported as an actionable failure, never substituted.
The host also escapes backslash bytes introduced by multibyte encoding inside
quoted values, since the native argument-file parser processes bytes.
Every execution owns an exclusively created temporary file; partial writes and
spawn failures clean it up, while successful launches retain it until that exact
process exits. A replacement execution never shares its predecessor's file.
For a known JDK older than 9, Rust hosts call
`lithe_core::execution::plan_classpath_jar_launch` instead. Under the same
command-line budget it replaces the effective `-cp`/`-classpath` value with a
host-owned JAR path and returns the ASCII `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` text: the
`Class-Path` header lists every entry, in order, as an absolute percent-encoded
UTF-8 `file:` URL (directories end in `/`), wrapped at 72 bytes. The host
answers whether each entry is a directory and writes the manifest-only JAR with
the same exclusive temporary-file lifecycle. Wildcard entries, drive-relative
Windows entries, `-jar` launches, and unknown JDK versions stay direct. This is
a Rust API only; there is no JSON command yet because the macOS process
argument limit (`ARG_MAX`) is far above the Windows cap, so a direct JDK 8
launch already succeeds there.
Strings returned by the core are UTF-8 JSON allocated by Rust. The caller must
release response strings with `lithe_core_free_string`.

The ACP Agent calls use an opaque handle for one agent process and connection
per workspace and agent; one connection carries many conversation sessions.
`lithe_agent_open_json` accepts `{ "agentId"?: string, "command"?: string,
"args": string[], "cwd": absolutePath, "dataDirectory"?: absolutePath,
"authentication"?: "apiKey" | "codexSubscription",
"provider"?: { "protocol": "responses" | "chatCompletions" | "anthropicMessages",
"baseUrl": string, "apiKey": string, "name"?: string, "model"?: string,
"allowInsecureHttp"?: bool } }`. With `agentId`, the host starts the adapter
installed by `agent.install` under `dataDirectory`. Omitted `authentication`
defaults to `apiKey`, which requires `provider`. Credentials travel over ACP
stdio, never in Lithe's adapter launch arguments, environment, or files.
This guarantee covers Lithe launching the ACP adapter, not the entire child
process tree. The pinned Claude SDK serializes object-valued `options.settings`
into the Claude Code CLI's `--settings` argument. Consequently,
`settings.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is visible in that child process's arguments;
SDK debug output may also record those arguments. This route does not eliminate
that upstream exposure. Moving the key solely to `options.env` requires separate
validation of precedence against user/project settings to preserve the selected
provider's credentials.
Responses providers use `gateway` authentication with `Authorization: Bearer
<key>`. Claude uses the pinned adapter's public `_meta.claudeCode.options` on
both `session/new` and `session/load`: its native API-key route is supplied in
SDK `env` and programmatic `settings.env`, with `apiKeyHelper` and competing
Bearer/OAuth/custom-header/cloud routes cleared. This avoids the adapter's
gateway placeholder Bearer token overriding a valid `x-api-key`; it does not
patch the adapter or change native CLI configuration files. Missing Claude
credentials fail before session creation instead of falling back to an account.
Claude API-key sessions also set `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_RETRIES=0`,
`CLAUDE_CODE_RETRY_WATCHDOG=0`, and
`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONSTREAMING_FALLBACK=1` in both option tiers. The native
budget cannot distinguish permanent errors and may honor minutes of Retry-After.
The Host owns a short interactive recovery budget instead: five total prompt
attempts, with 0.5/1/2/4-second delays. Only known temporary failures before any
reply, thought, plan, tool or permission progress can be replayed. Permanent
credentials/access/request/quota errors fail immediately. Native model resolution
can still probe a missing model twice; this is not another Host attempt.
Claude API-key connections negotiate AIR v1 `sessionFailure` alongside
`recommendedValue`. A terminal AIR failure in a successful `end_turn` response
is normalized to `requestFailed`; its category/actions determine retryability,
and title/details retain the actionable error. For generic service failures,
a fixed CLI `API Error:` HTTP banner can veto retries for permanent statuses;
text never enables a retry. Legacy categorical JSON-RPC `errorKind` remains
supported; unknown legacy errors are terminal. The failed idle SDK request is
interrupted before resubmission to avoid duplicated native HTTP requests.
Codex API-key sessions use native recovery with `request_max_retries=0` and
`stream_max_retries=4`, so HTTP and stream retries cannot multiply. The pinned
ACP adapter replaces the gateway provider table; a first-party stdio relay
applies those public App Server fields on `thread/start`, `thread/resume` and
`thread/fork`, and disables `features.unbounded_connection_retries`. Other
configuration, native history, tools and stream processing remain engine-owned.
The relay also retains native error information in a JSON `litheCodexFailure`
envelope inside the AIR failure title, because the adapter otherwise drops
`codexErrorInfo`, HTTP status and details from retry warnings. Only negotiated
failure metadata is decoded; assistant/model text never enters this policy.
Titles presented as errors are decoded to the original actionable message.
Known permanent native categories or HTTP 4xx (except 408/409/429) stop recovery
immediately, even when the service supplies a long `Retry-After`. Unknown native
errors retain their native retry decision. The Host recovery window applies
only before any work; subsequent native recovery is engine-owned.
Native HTTP 429 may terminate without stream recovery. Before any reply,
thought, plan, tool or permission progress, only this typed 429 gap may replay
the settled prompt with short Host delays. It shares the same five-attempt
counter with native recovery, rather than adding another budget; recognized
quota/context/budget exhaustion is permanent. No other Codex terminal failure
automatically resubmits a prompt. Subscription sessions preserve native login,
refresh and retry policy; custom ACP commands receive no Codex configuration.

Each API-key Codex launch owns `<system-temp>/lithe-codex-retry-<UUID>/` until its
process tree stops. Its script comes from embedded first-party source and holds
no credential. Preparation/spawn failure, cancellation and completion remove
the directory. The host does not write installed packages, bundles, CLI settings
or user configuration; this runtime helper is excluded from worktree reuse.
The route fixture is `shared/fixtures/agent/acp-events-v1.json`'s
`upstream.claudeSessionRouting`. The
user's own CLI is passed as `CODEX_PATH` or `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE`, and a
non-empty `model` as `CODEX_CONFIG` or `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`. Without `agentId`, `command` runs
a user-provided agent that must support gateway sign-in with a Responses
provider. Agents start with the executable's directory and the login shell's
`PATH` first. API-key mode never falls back to account login. Invalid settings
and launch failures are reported as a `stopped` event with a message.

`codexSubscription` is accepted only for `agentId: "codex-acp"` with no
`provider`. It reuses the locally installed Codex CLI and its own account storage
(including `CODEX_HOME`). The child uses the official `openai` model provider;
inherited API-key, endpoint, token and gateway overrides are removed for this
child only. Session configuration also clears `openai_base_url` and selects the
official `chatgpt_base_url`, preventing saved custom routes from overriding the
subscription selection. The quota probe receives the same route overrides. No Lithe HTTP provider, stored API key or configured provider model
is consulted. Codex owns login, token refresh and session model options.
The pinned ACP adapter's `_auth/status_update` notification confirms the account.
An existing account proceeds to `account` then `ready`; otherwise
`authenticationRequired` waits for the user's `authenticate` command before
`authenticating` opens the upstream ChatGPT browser login. Login is cancellable
by closing the handle, with a five-minute deadline. Account loss or email change
disconnects the connection rather than silently changing its billing identity.
`account` exposes only nullable `email` and `plan`, never credentials.

`refreshQuota` is ignored outside subscription mode, coalesced while in flight,
and throttled to one read per connection per 60 seconds. The host uses a bounded
20-second, short-lived official `codex app-server` process because codex-acp
1.13.1 does not expose structured rate limits. It only initializes, checks
`account/read`, reads `account/rateLimits/read`, and checks the account again;
it never creates a thread or prompt. The process tree is owned by the connection
and terminated after the query or cancellation. The account email must match
the active ACP account; missing identity cannot prove a match. This is not a
workspace/account-ID verification guarantee: the upstream ACP identity provides
no stable account ID. Lithe reads no credential files for this path.

`quota.snapshot` has `fetchedAt` (Unix seconds) and deterministic `windows` with
`id`, `name`, `limitSeconds`, nullable `usedPercent` (0–100) and nullable
`resetsAt` (Unix seconds). Actual window durations are preserved; primary does
not imply five hours. Unknown usage remains null. `quotaFailed.code` is
`unavailable`, `timeout`, `unparsable`, `unauthorized`, or `accountChanged`.
Consumers retain the last snapshot as stale for transient errors, clear it on
identity failures/disconnect, and never reinterpret unknown as zero. The macOS
composer shows a small chip to the right of context usage, refreshes while
visible and active, and requests a throttled refresh after turns. Hover details
include all windows and reset times; API-key connections show no quota chip.

`lithe_agent_send_json` queues one command: `newSession`, `loadSession`,
`listSessions`, `setConfigOption`, `prompt`, `cancel`, `permission`, `authenticate`,
or `refreshQuota`. Results arrive as events:
`ready`, `sessionCreated`, `sessionLoaded`, `sessions`, `update`, `permission`,
`sessionConfigured`, `turnRetrying`, `turnActivity`, `turnCancelling`, `turnFinished`, `requestFailed`, `stopped`,
`authenticationRequired`, `authenticating`, `account`, `quota`, and `quotaFailed`. Commands and events, including
their camel-case field names, are fixed by
`shared/fixtures/agent/acp-events-v1.json`; `token` values are echoed so a caller
can correlate concurrent requests. `stopReason` uses ACP wire names such as
`end_turn` and `cancelled`.

`prompt` retains `text` and optionally carries ordered `files` entries with `uri`
(a native `file://` URL) and `name` (the display filename). The host validates up to
32 references and sends upstream ACP `resource_link` blocks after the text block;
empty text is allowed when files are present. It never reads, copies, or embeds
file bytes. These native resource URLs identify user-selected context, not portable
workspace records; the agent owns reading, permissions, and history. Invalid
references produce `requestFailed` before reserving a turn. Older text-only callers
remain compatible by omitting `files`.

`sessionCreated` and `sessionLoaded` optionally carry the agent's `configOptions`.
`setConfigOption` carries `token`, `sessionId`, `configId`, and a select-option
string `value`; the host uses ACP `session/set_config_option`. Its acknowledged
full option list arrives as `sessionConfigured`. Consumers also accept ACP
`config_option_update` notifications. Agent-provided IDs, choices and current
values remain authoritative; unsupported controls are not synthesized.
Configuration failure echoes the token and does not finish a prompt. Native clients may stage next-turn choices while a
prompt is active, without sending configuration commands or replacing the
Agent-confirmed values. The macOS conversation model keeps that intent per
session and submits it only after a terminal turn event, model first and then
one acknowledged choice at a time against the latest option list. Rejection,
unconfirmed values, or removed choices clear the remaining intent and surface a
configuration error; disconnect clears it as well. The next prompt remains
blocked until configuration requests finish. This does not change the Host's
busy-session rejection or the command/event shape.

For a new session, the host also preserves the adapter's optional legacy model
catalog while decoding the ACP response and negotiates only the versioned
`jetbrains.air.recommendedValue` extension. If the configured current model is
absent from that catalog, the host prefers an upstream recommendation present in
both the catalog and selector. Without a usable recommendation it selects the
first catalog model available in the selector, including grouped options. The
host requests that model before publishing `sessionCreated`; only the
acknowledged full configuration is exposed, keeping the official choices visible
after the adapter removes its synthetic unknown model. Both
requests share the session creation deadline; rejection, timeout, or an
unconfirmed selection emits `requestFailed`. Valid configured models, loaded
history, and global CLI files remain unchanged. Missing or malformed optional
catalog data or an empty catalog/selector intersection leaves standard ACP
behavior intact. The `upstream`
scenarios in the agent fixture protect this workflow without changing the
command/event JSON shape.

A `cancel` answers pending permissions with `cancelled`, sends one
ACP `session/cancel`, and reports `turnCancelling`. The session remains busy
until its prompt response arrives. A second prompt and configuration changes
are rejected while it is busy. If the agent fails to acknowledge within ten
seconds, the connection fails and its process tree is stopped; clients retain
the visible transcript and offer reconnect followed by `session/load`. This
explicit recovery prevents another message from entering a lost cancelled turn.
Other sessions on the same process are also detached on this failure.
Normal cancellation does not restart the process.

Normal `prompt` turns have no absolute wall-clock deadline. Silence alone cannot
prove that model reasoning or a tool has stalled. After five minutes without
reported reply, thought, plan or tool progress, the host emits advisory
`turnActivity` with `sessionId` and `quiet: true`, once per quiet interval. Actual
progress emits `quiet: false` and starts a fresh advisory interval. The threshold
is fixed in `agent-turn-policy.json`, consumed by the shared Host and the Windows
frontend monitor. This notice never cancels, releases or replays the prompt.
Clients offer continue waiting (dismiss only) and stop, preserving busy state,
transcript, edits and elapsed time. Completion, failure and disconnect clear it.
Permission and stopping states take precedence over the advisory.

Permission decisions have no timer. The host tracks all pending permissions in
that turn and suspends the quiet advisory until all are answered, then starts a
fresh interval. Registration stays ordered under the permission/turn locks;
waiting and responding run in an SDK-owned task so inbound updates, additional
permission requests and connection EOF are not blocked. Cancel, terminal prompt
response and connection shutdown settle every pending request with `cancelled`.
Initialization, session/configuration requests, pre-work failure recovery and
cancellation acknowledgment retain their own bounded deadlines. Tool execution
and model-request budgets belong to the upstream Agent. This policy does not
provide a new user-configurable task budget.

The pre-work API-key reconnecting window is twenty seconds from the first temporary
failure, in addition to the initial request and at most ten seconds to confirm
cancellation. It does not reset on each retry. Actual progress removes this
short window and prohibits whole-turn replay; normal turn duration remains unlimited.
Codex owns later stream recovery after progress. While its public error metadata
reports `willRetry: true`, the Host retains the same busy turn without a recovery
deadline or a second attempt limit, and never replays the whole prompt. Native
`stream_max_retries=4` remains configured; this is not unbounded native retry.
Permanent errors, explicit terminal failure, process/connection closure and user
Stop still end the turn through the existing acknowledgment/cleanup paths. A
terminal error preserves local messages and edits; explicit continuation reuses
the session, or reloads native history after reconnection, without automatically
resending the original request. Upstream persistence of unfinished fragments is
not guaranteed. Pre-work window expiry retains the same busy/cancel/acknowledgment semantics
above and reports the last provider error. During backoff, user cancellation
ends the local turn without another prompt. `turnRetrying` carries `sessionId`,
a unique Host or native `turnId`, and `attempt` (at least 2). Pre-work recovery
includes `maxAttempts` (5); native recovery after work omits it, because observed
warnings cannot establish a Host limit for engine-owned requests. It is a
recovery observation, not actual work or a terminal event. macOS presents
“Reconnecting 2/5…” with elapsed time; it clears counts on progress or completion
and ignores retries for retired turns. With no maximum it presents
“Reconnecting…”. Five minutes after the first post-work recovery warning, the
Host emits the same quiet advisory; further warnings cannot postpone it. Actual
progress clears it and starts normal quiet tracking again. macOS shows a recovery
waiting notice with Continue waiting and Stop; dismissal does not resend or
release the busy turn. Permission and Stop take priority. No silent timer implies
thinking or retry.
Generic ACP support does not imply control of its retry engine. Unadapted agents
retain their native retry policy without a Host absolute prompt limit; reliable
counts and a short recovery window require explicit provider recovery events or
a verified configuration adapter. Lithe never applies blind prompt replay to
arbitrary agents.

ACP `usage_update` notifications are forwarded unchanged in `update`, with
`used` (tokens currently in context) and `size` (context window capacity), scoped
by `sessionId`. Consumers replace the previous snapshot, allowing usage to drop
after compaction; these values are not cumulative billing tokens. Missing or
invalid data and a zero capacity represent unknown usage, not an empty window.
The macOS indicator clears stale capacity on disconnect or confirmed model
changes and waits for a new report; it does not infer limits from model names.

`turnFinished` optionally includes the ACP prompt response's `usage` object:
required unsigned `totalTokens`, `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, and optional
`thoughtTokens`, `cachedReadTokens`, `cachedWriteTokens`. The pinned SDK's
`unstable_end_turn_token_usage` feature preserves these counters; absent, null
or invalid usage is omitted without preventing completion. Zero is a reported
value. Counters are Agent-owned: consumers must not infer a per-turn aggregate,
session delta or billing amount, because the adapters' accounting scopes differ.
They must not derive these counters from context occupancy or subscription quota.
`acp-events-v1.json` covers completion both with and without usage.

macOS keeps local turn statistics in memory. Elapsed time uses a monotonic clock
from user submission (including queued session creation/loading, tools and
permission waits) until completion, request failure or disconnect. Cancellation
continues timing until acknowledged. Each observed turn keeps a frozen footer
before the next user message; tab switches do not reset it. Replayed history
does not fabricate timing or token measurements absent from the Agent's records.

Tool updates preserve ACP `kind`, `locations`, `rawInput`, `rawOutput`, and
`content` (including diffs). Partial updates replace only fields supplied by
the agent. Permission displays combine already received tool details with the
permission request, and distinguish allow/reject option kinds.

The caller must close each handle
exactly once; closing revokes callbacks and stops the process tree, force
killing processes that do not exit after a short grace period. The callback
context must remain valid until close returns. This API is owned by
`lithe-agent-host` and is separate from the synchronous JSON command envelope.

## Envelope

The typed `lithe_core::ai` API provides credential-free commit request planning,
configuration parsing, and response decoding. Its [AI commit contract](ai-commit.md)
documents the Windows adapter and current macOS migration boundary. It does not
add a JSON command or change the C ABI.

Every request has this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "request-id",
  "operationId": "operation-id",
  "timeoutMilliseconds": 30000,
  "command": "workspace.search",
  "payload": {}
}
```

`operationId` is optional for compatibility and defaults to `id` when `id` is
present. `timeoutMilliseconds` is optional; a positive value starts a
cooperative deadline. `lithe_core_cancel` is thread-safe and returns `1` when
the operation is active. Cancellation and deadlines are checked at command
boundaries, workspace traversal points, and Git process waits. They return
`cancelled` or `timed_out` in the standard error envelope.

Successful responses contain `ok: true` and `data`. Failed responses contain a
stable error code and a user-facing message:

```json
{
  "id": "request-id",
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "Invalid JSON request"
  }
}
```

## Commands

### Agent adapters

`agent.parseProviderConfiguration` takes `{source, configuration}` with `source`
equal to `codex` (TOML) or `claude` (JSON). It reuses the typed AI configuration
parsers with an empty environment and returns provider metadata only, without
credentials or credential-presence flags. Configuration text is limited to
64 KiB UTF-8. Invalid source, malformed text and oversized input return
`invalid_request` without raw input or parser diagnostics. The fixture is
`shared/fixtures/agent/provider-configuration-v1.json`. Hosts extract explicit
API keys, validate Agent protocol compatibility, and persist credentials in their
native vault. This operation does not discover or write local CLI files.

`agent.status`, `agent.install`, `agent.uninstall`, and `agent.installCli` manage ACP adapters in
`<dataDirectory>/agents/<agentId>`, using the Node.js and npm the user installed.
Lithe never installs Node.js or npm; the agents' own command-line tools are installed only through `agent.installCli` on an explicit user action. `agent.status`
detects Node.js and npm through the login shell's `PATH` and lists every
supported agent with its pinned version, installed version, provider protocol,
and blocking issues. Adapters that drive the agent's own CLI (Codex, Claude Code) report the
CLI found on that `PATH` with its minimum version; they are installed with
`--omit=optional`, so their bundled CLI copy is not downloaded, and are launched
with the user's CLI through the adapter's variable (`CODEX_PATH`,
`CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE`). A missing or
too old CLI is an issue for the user to resolve, never installed by Lithe.
`agent.install` runs `npm install` into a staging directory
and replaces the previous install only after the adapter executable exists; it
honors `operationId` cancellation and `timeoutMilliseconds`. Failures use
`runtime_missing` (Node.js or npm unusable), `process_failed` (npm failed, with
its output tail), `invalid_request`, `cancelled`, or `timed_out`. Payloads and
results are fixed by `shared/fixtures/agent/agent-management-v1.json`.

`agent.installCli` resolves the current PATH executable and its installation
owner again on each explicit action. A missing CLI uses npm; an existing npm CLI
requires the selected npm's global root, package manifest/bin and active link
to agree before `npm install -g <package>@latest`. Homebrew requires the active
target to belong to its reported Caskroom/Cellar and an installed package receipt;
it runs `brew upgrade --cask/--formula <owning-package>`, retaining the installed
channel. A standard Claude native launcher uses `claude update`. Unknown,
broken, unrecorded, or mismatched Node/npm installations require manual updating;
there is no force overwrite, installer migration or automatic npm fallback.
After completion, the host refreshes the login-shell PATH and requires the CLI
selected there to meet the adapter's minimum version before returning `cliVersion`.
The successful response also includes optional `updaterWarning` (null for a clean
exit, a bounded output tail for a recovered installer failure). A nonzero exit
can succeed only if the CLI is now present and usable, and its numeric version
strictly increased compared with the pre-update CLI (or it was previously absent).
An unchanged, downgraded, missing or still-too-old CLI remains `process_failed`;
cancellation, timeout and process-start failure never recover through a version
probe. Hosts show the verified version as success and keep any warning/log separate
from errors. Older responses without `updaterWarning` decode as a clean result.
Node.js and npm remain user-managed. Detection is read-only and locally bounded.

`agent.status` includes optional `cli.installation` with `source` (`npm`,
`homebrew`, `native`, `missing`, `unknown`), `canUpdate`, and display-only
`updateHint`. Hosts show the source and guidance, and offer automatic update
only when `canUpdate` is true. The hint is never executable input. Absent fields
remain backward compatible with older hosts. Windows installer/shim ownership
has not been verified; unrecognized installations use the manual path.
The minimum CLI version is a compatibility requirement, not a latest-version
check. macOS keeps an explicit update action available for compatible CLIs whose
installation owner permits it, including when the preflight row is collapsed.
After a successful update, users reconnect the Agent to start the updated CLI
and obtain its model catalog; existing conversations are not interrupted automatically.

`agent.install` and `agent.installCli` publish `agentInstallProgress` through the
existing synchronous `execute_json_with_events`/C ABI event callback. Each event
carries the request's `operationId` and a `progress` object: `stage` (`preparing`,
`downloading`, `installing`, `updating`), `downloadedBytes` (received archive body bytes),
`bytesPerSecond` (most recent sample), `elapsedMilliseconds`, and
`idleMilliseconds` (since the last archive bytes). Counters contain no URLs,
headers, credentials, or paths. npm still owns fetching, proxies, retries, cache,
and extraction. A built-in Node observer counts bytes without consuming its
stream and restores inherited `NODE_OPTIONS` before npm starts child scripts.
No total or overall percentage is supplied: npm can discover additional packages
and may use cached packages. Events stop before the final response, including
failure, timeout, and cancellation. Hosts reject stale operation IDs and clear
live counters at completion. Examples are in `agent-management-v1.json`.
Homebrew and native updaters emit `updating` with zero transfer counters: their
package manager owns the download and Lithe does not infer bytes from logs.

### Maven test results

`maven.testResults` accepts `{ "root": string, "output": string }` and parses
the bounded text emitted by Maven Surefire or Failsafe after a JUnit 4/5 class
or method run. `root` must be an existing workspace directory and `output` is
limited to 500,000 characters. The response is:

```json
{
  "testsRun": 4,
  "failures": 1,
  "errors": 1,
  "skipped": 1,
  "passed": 1,
  "success": false,
  "failureDetails": [
    {
      "name": "additionIsCorrect(com.example.CalculatorTest)",
      "kind": "failure",
      "message": "expected <4> but was <5>",
      "path": "src/test/java/com/example/CalculatorTest.java",
      "line": 42,
      "column": null
    }
  ]
}
```

`kind` is `failure` or `error`; `path` is a workspace-relative source path
when a stack frame or failure footer can be resolved unambiguously. Relative
source lookup requires a complete workspace index, prefers a unique full
package-path suffix at a path boundary, and falls back to a unique filename
only when no package-path candidate exists. Ambiguous matches or an incomplete
scan (including the 10,000-directory limit) leave the location `null`.
All locations use one-based lines with nullable columns. `passed` is derived from the summary and never
negative. A final `Results` summary is preferred; when Maven only prints
per-class summaries, the counts are aggregated. Failure details retain Maven's output order and are bounded to
10,000 entries. A parser or size violation returns the standard
`parse_failed` error.

The request may also carry `reports: { module, sourcePath, classes,
notBeforeMillis }` naming the run's workspace-relative Maven module directory
(`null` or `.` for the root), the binary names of the selected test classes, and
the run's start time in Unix milliseconds. When `module` is absent and
`sourcePath` names a workspace-relative test file, the module is the nearest
directory above that file holding a `pom.xml`. An empty or absent `classes`
reads every report in the module written at or after `notBeforeMillis`. Core then reads the Surefire/Failsafe XML reports
the run wrote and returns `testCases`, otherwise an empty list:

```json
{ "className": "com.example.CalculatorTest", "method": "additionIsCorrect",
  "status": "failed", "message": "expected <4> but was <5>", "invocations": 1 }
```

Reports are searched in the module's configured Surefire/Failsafe
`reportsDirectory` values plus `<build directory>/surefire-reports` and
`failsafe-reports`. Only `TEST-<class>.xml` and nested `TEST-<class>$*.xml`
files modified at or after `notBeforeMillis` are read, so an earlier run's
reports never produce outcomes. `method` drops parameter lists and invocation
indexes; invocations that report a display name instead of a method are
omitted. `status` is `passed`, `failed`, `error`, or `skipped`; when a method
has several invocations, the most severe wins (error, failed, passed, skipped)
and `message` comes from the first invocation with that status. Results are
ordered by `className`, then `method`. Core reads at most 512 reports of up to
32 MiB each and returns at most 10,000 methods; malformed reports are skipped.
A module outside the workspace or a class name that is not a Java binary name
returns `invalid_request`. A class with no case means "no recorded outcome",
never "passed". Platform stores must associate the response with the
launch operation and discard it after cancellation, replacement, or workspace
change.

Workspace paths in responses are relative and use `/` separators. Line numbers
are one-based. `git.status.repositoryRoot` may be an absolute path when the
opened workspace is a subdirectory of the repository; all Git change paths are
relative to that repository root. `git.status.ahead` and `behind` report the
current branch's tracking counts and are zero when no upstream is configured.
`workspace.repositories.repositories` is ordered with the containing workspace
repository first when present, then repositories under the opened workspace by
workspace containment, depth, and path. Each entry contains an absolute native
`path` because repository roots are platform boundary values and may be outside
the opened folder when the folder is nested inside a checkout. Canonical paths
are reported in plain native form: Core strips the Windows verbatim `\\?\`
prefix only for supported drive/UNC paths so roots remain valid Git working
directories after consumers normalize separators. On Windows, path components
ending in an ASCII dot or space, reserved DOS device basenames, verbatim dot
segments, and non-drive/non-UNC device namespaces are
unsupported: discovery, status, watch context and Git reads return
`invalid_request` before filesystem lookup, rather than aliasing another path.
The same validation applies after canonicalization and to Git-reported paths;
missing-worktree fallbacks must not suppress it. Frontend file resolution
normalizes native UNC/verbatim inputs before deciding whether to join a repository
root, and rejects unsupported names before stripping their prefix. Remote/WSL
identifiers retain their protocol and POSIX name semantics. Chinese names,
embedded spaces and long paths are not rejected by length; native Git/filesystem
errors remain visible. In particular, Windows may reject an over-MAX_PATH Git
working directory at process creation even when filesystem lookup succeeds;
this is reported as `process_start_failed`, not a missing repository. Shared examples live in `shared/fixtures/git/windows-paths.json`.
Core treats both
`.git` directories and `.git` files as repository markers. The default traversal
skips dot-prefixed descendant directories and the built-in workspace hidden
directory names (including `.build`, `node_modules`, `target`, `build`,
`DerivedData`, `dist` and `coverage`). `.worktree` and `.worktrees` remain
traversable checkout containers; the same exclusions apply inside them.
Traversal continues below eligible discovered repositories, including ordinary
`vendor` source checkouts. An explicitly opened root and its containing repository
are never excluded by their names. These are automatic discovery rules, not Git
tracking rules: `.gitignore` and file-tree visibility overrides do not configure
repository ownership. The rules apply before repository status/reference
aggregation on both hosts. Examples live in
`shared/fixtures/workspace/repository-visibility-v1.json`.
Git metadata itself is not traversed.
Symbolic directory links are not followed, preventing cycles and traversal
outside the workspace. Callers may explicitly supply `maxDirectories` and
`maxDepth` to request a bounded scan; product consumers omit these limits.
Traversal checks cancellation between directories and entries.
`git.worktrees.worktrees` is ordered with the primary worktree first and then
by path. Each entry contains `path`, `head`, nullable `branch`, `isCurrent`,
`isPrimary`, `isBare`, `isDetached`, `isLocked`, nullable `lockReason`,
`isPrunable`, and nullable `pruneReason`. The path is absolute because linked
worktrees may live outside the opened workspace; clients must treat it as an
opaque native boundary value and must not persist it as a portable identifier.
Core reads the list with one porcelain operation and does not run status in
each checkout.
For a rename or copy, each change uses the destination as `path` and preserves
the source as `originalPath`; platform mutations that act on the Git entry pass
both paths back to Core.
The core rejects absolute paths and `..`
traversal for file commands. Native file dialogs, file watching, PTY/ConPTY,
Java processes, and runtime discovery remain platform adapters.

`git.history.recentReferences` contains at most five existing local branches in
most-recently-used order. The current branch is first. Core derives checkout
history from the repository's HEAD reflog, de-duplicates branch names, ignores
detached or deleted references, and fills missing entries deterministically.
The remote HEAD target is preferred as the default branch, followed by `main`,
`master`, and the remaining local references in refname order.

The protocol version is currently `1`. Add a fixture under `shared/fixtures/`
before changing a response shape or search rule.

`document.lifecycle` accepts a discriminated `state` (`clean`, `dirty`,
`saving`, or `conflict`) and one typed `event`. It returns the next state plus
one platform effect such as `writeToDisk`, `reloadFromDisk`, or
`showConflict`. `saving` carries the snapshot revision and `operationId`, so a
stale completion cannot clear newer edits. Live text, editor models, selections,
watchers, and native file I/O stay platform-owned; local keystrokes update the
same revision semantics in-process and never cross the Rust boundary.
`diskConflict` preserves the current editor revision and enters `conflict` from
any state when a native guarded write rejects its expected disk baseline or a
file is missing. Native document saves compare the last acknowledged raw disk
bytes with disk inside the platform write operation; the editor may use UTF-8,
UTF-8 with BOM, GBK, GB18030, Shift JIS, or Windows-1252 while the Core
lifecycle remains encoding-agnostic. Watchers are refresh hints, not write
authorization. Conflict resolution acknowledges only the disk snapshot
observed by the user, and subsequent saves must validate that snapshot again. The
portable examples are in `shared/fixtures/documents/lifecycle-v1.json`.

GitHub command shapes, authorization behavior, and supported pull-request
operations are documented in [`github.md`](github.md). Rust Core performs no
network or credential I/O for these commands.

`community.discourse.auth.begin` accepts an HTTPS `origin`, stable `clientId`,
user-visible `applicationName`, platform-owned `authRedirect`, and a non-empty
array of supported `scopes`. It returns an opaque `flowId`, an
`authorizationUrl` that requests RSA-OAEP padding, and an `expiresAt` Unix
timestamp. The private key and nonce remain in Rust memory and expire after ten
minutes. `community.discourse.auth.complete` accepts that `flowId` and the full
`callbackUrl`; it consumes the flow, verifies the callback target, decrypts the
payload, and checks the nonce before returning `userApiKey` and `apiVersion`.
Platform hosts open the browser, receive their registered URL scheme, and store
the returned credential in Keychain or Windows Credential Manager. They do not
implement Discourse cryptography or callback validation.

The authenticated community commands accept `origin`, `userApiKey`, and
`clientId` plus their operation-specific fields. Rust owns HTTPS requests,
authentication headers, a 30-second request timeout, a 5 MB response limit,
Discourse JSON decoding, deterministic post ordering, and HTML sanitization.
Platform clients never issue a parallel Discourse request or parse a second
response shape. Credential vault reads and writes remain native adapters; the
credential is passed to Core only for the duration of one command.

`git.watchContext` accepts `{ "root": string }`. When `root` is not inside a
Git repository, it returns `null`. Otherwise it returns
`{ "repositoryRoot": string, "gitDirectory": string, "gitCommonDirectory": string }`;
all three fields are absolute filesystem paths.

`git.pullRequestContext` accepts `{ "root": string }` and returns
`currentBranch`, `suggestedBaseBranch`, `suggestedPublishBranch`,
`requiresPublish`, `detached`, and `hasUncommittedChanges`. For detached
worktrees, Core uses the worktree HEAD reflog's oldest commit and refs pointing
at that commit to suggest the branch from which the worktree started. For a
named branch, `requiresPublish` remains true until its current HEAD is present
on the same branch under `origin`, because GitHub repository identity is also
resolved from `origin`.

`git.command` accepts `{ "root": string, "arguments": string[], "input": string? }`.
Arguments are passed directly to the Git executable without a shell. A
successful process launch returns `{ "arguments": string[], "output": string,
"stdout": string, "stderr": string, "exitCode": number, "invocations":
GitCommandInvocation[], "operationError": CoreError? }` even when Git exits
non-zero. `GitCommandInvocation` is `{ "arguments": string[], "stdout": string,
"stderr": string, "exitCode": number }`. The top-level `arguments`, streams,
and exit code always equal the final invocation for compatibility, and `output`
is that invocation's `stdout` followed by `stderr`; `invocations` records every
subprocess in execution order. Validation, process-start, and workspace failures
that occur before Git starts use the standard error envelope. If a follow-up
validation or probe fails after at least one subprocess was recorded, the
response retains the invocation trace and includes the failure as
`operationError`.

`git.repositoryRoot` accepts `{ "root": string }` and returns the normalized
absolute repository root or `null` when the path is not inside a repository. It
is read-only and does not acquire the repository write lease.

`git.command` and typed Git writers share the repository's write lease, including
linked worktrees. A competing request fails with `invalid_request` while a writer
is active; it does not wait behind a mutex outside its cancellation deadline.

Git requests may include optional envelope metadata `gitExecution`:
`{ executable?: string | null, interactive?: boolean, useCredentialHelper?: boolean,
fetchDefaults?: GitFetchOptions, detailedFetch?: boolean, source?: "user" | "background" | "unknown" }`. Defaults are PATH,
noninteractive, helper enabled, normal Fetch defaults, and legacy Fetch results.
An executable must be an absolute native path to Git 2.31 or newer. Interactive
commands require an event receiver. These values are request-scoped, including
nested requests, and never implicitly persist. Both current applications opt
into detailed Fetch and supply their application settings snapshot.

`git.fetchPlan` accepts `{ options?: GitFetchOptions, root?: string }`. Options are
`{ remote?: string | null, prune?: boolean, submodules?: "inherit" | "no" |
"onDemand" | "yes", tags?: "inherit" | "all" | "none" | "prune" }`. It returns
`{ options, arguments, commands?: string[][] }`. Without `root` the operation is
pure. With `root`, commands expand into sorted enabled remotes, using the same
resolver as detailed execution. `remote.<name>.skipFetchAll` is respected when
fetching all remotes, using Git's boolean parser: a valueless key is true, an
explicit empty value is false, and nonzero numbers are true. Invalid boolean
values fail preflight rather than silently enabling a remote. A selected name
must exist; URLs and argument text are not
accepted as remote names. An empty enabled set is an explicit error.

Defaults are all remotes, pruning enabled, and inherited submodule/tag policy.
Tag modes map to no override, `--tags`, `--no-tags`, or `--prune-tags`; tag pruning
requires `prune: true`. `git.write` with `operation: "fetch"` accepts optional
`fetchOptions`. Supplied one-time values override repository `lithe.fetch.*`
preferences, which override `gitExecution.fetchDefaults`. Unknown fields and
Fetch options supplied to another mutation are rejected. With `detailedFetch`,
individual remote errors preserve partial successes and an `operationError`
summarizes failure; legacy clients retain one `fetch --all` invocation.

All captured non-config invocations get named temporary presentation policy
through appended `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` entries: `color.ui=false`,
`core.quotepath=false`, `log.showSignature=false`. Helper reset is appended only
when the supplied preference disables helpers or an explicit authentication
retry selected it. Config commands are exempt so provenance is not obscured.
Fetch's existing explicit flags remain in the argument vector for compatibility.
`LC_ALL=C`, pager suppression and no terminal prompting are child-local policy.
Transfer progress is requested explicitly. No config file is implicitly modified.

`git.remoteUrl` accepts `{ root, remote }` and returns `{ url: string | null }`.
It uses the internal configuration-read path: a missing key is successful and
produces no command row. Invalid requests and real access/executable failures
remain structured errors. The configured value is used for repository discovery;
it is not console output. See `shared/fixtures/git/remote-url-v1.json`.

`git.executionInspect` takes `{ root, scope?: "local" | "global" }`, default local.
It returns `{ executable, version, scope, entries, fields, temporaryConfig,
fetchOptions, fetchError, fetchSources, credentialHelperEnabled,
interactiveAuthentication }`. Entries are `{ key, value, scope, origin, effective }`
in Git precedence order, limited to relevant configuration and redacted. Fields
are `{ key, choices: string[], configuredValues: string[] }` from the selected
file without expanding includes. Fetch source values are `{ scope, origin }`
per preference; application sources have null origins. Invalid repository
preferences return null `fetchOptions` and a structured `fetchError`.

`git.executionConfigure` adds `{ key, value: string | null, expectedValues:
string[] }` to the same request. It permits `fetch.prune`, `fetch.prunetags`,
`fetch.recursesubmodules`, `pull.rebase`, `pull.ff`, `push.default`,
`credential.usehttppath`, and local-only `lithe.fetch.prune`,
`lithe.fetch.submodules`, `lithe.fetch.tags`, using the advertised choices.
Null removes the selected file's override. An optimistic expected-values check
rejects a detected intervening edit, then one Git config transaction runs under
Lithe's repository write lease. It is not an atomic CAS against external writers.
The returned snapshot reflects the saved state. No arbitrary script/argument
setting is editable through this command.

`git.authRespond` takes `{ requestId: string, answer: string | null }` and returns
`{ accepted: boolean }`. Opaque IDs are invocation-owned, unguessable and single
use; stale or invalid answers return false. Answers are bounded to 8 KiB without
NUL/newlines. Null cancels the challenge. Hosts also cancel its owning operation
when the user cancels the dialog. An event with `retry: true` requires the exact
answer `"retry"` to repeat the failed transfer with helper bypass, at most three
total attempts. The AskPass C ABI is called only in the child app's early helper
mode. Credential answers are never copied into events or settings.

See `shared/fixtures/git/{fetch-plan,execution-events,execution-policy}-v1.json`
and [Git execution and project console](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-12-git-execution-and-project-console.md).

The additive `lithe_core_execute_json_with_events(request, callback, context)`
C ABI and Rust `execute_json_with_events` API deliver sanitized Git diagnostics
while the existing synchronous request runs. Event strings are borrowed only
for the callback; clients must copy them before returning. Callbacks are serial
on the caller's worker thread and complete before the final response returns.
Callbacks may synchronously call Core, for example to answer `git.authRespond`.
Nested requests do not inherit the outer observer; they can install a separate
observer explicitly. Returning from a nested request restores the outer request's
event identity, cancellation registration, and absolute deadline.
No arbitrary environment values, authentication answers or command stdin are emitted.
The named nonsecret temporary configuration is explicit diagnostic metadata.

Each event has `operationId` and `type`:

| Type | Additional fields |
| --- | --- |
| `requestStarted` | none; cancellation is registered before delivery |
| `started` | `invocationId`, `workingDirectory`, `arguments`, nullable resolved `executable`, `temporaryConfig` key/value pairs, `displayArguments`, `globalArguments`, `source` |
| `output` | `invocationId`, `stream` (`stdout`/`stderr`), `text`, `progress`, `truncated`, optional `progressDetails` (`stage`, nullable `percent`, `completed`, `total`) |
| `finished` | `invocationId`, nullable `exitCode`, monotonic `durationMilliseconds`, nullable `error`, `expectedExit` |
| `requestFinished` | nullable `error`, including failures before a child started |
| `authentication` | `requestId`, `prompt`, `secret`, `attempt`, optional `retry`, `workingDirectory` |
| `remoteResult` | `remote`, `succeeded`, nullable structured `error`, updated/deleted reference lists and counts, `referencesTruncated`, `referencesAvailable` |

`invocationId` is scoped to the request. `workingDirectory` is a native
absolute-path diagnostic, not a shared workspace identifier. Arguments/output
are redacted diagnostics; preview alone is not proof of process startup. An
unknown exit status remains null. A failed start may produce `finished` without
`started`; consumers must not fabricate an executed command from that event.
Native journals track `requestStarted` separately from visible command records.
The native receiver retains the originating request directory so a failure before
`started` can be shown as an unconfirmed request with no fabricated arguments or
exit code. Successfully completed internal queries still produce no history row.
A request-start event must not allocate a placeholder or consume command-history capacity. Clearing
history suppresses late invocations from requests already in preflight, while
started operations remain cancellable until `requestFinished`, even after their
text is cleared. See `shared/fixtures/git/console-lifecycle-v1.json`.
Console presentation entries include an optional `notice`: `waitingForOutput`,
`completedWithoutOutput`, or `fetchUnchanged`. Native hosts localize this as a
status line, separate from retained Git stdout/stderr and copied command output.
Notices require empty retained output, no progress, no truncation and no failure.
`fetchUnchanged` additionally requires a completed successful Fetch and a
`remoteResult` with `succeeded: true`, `referencesAvailable: true`, and explicit
zero `updatedReferenceCount` and `deletedReferenceCount`. Missing counts must not
be treated as zero. Other successful empty results use `completedWithoutOutput`.

`displayArguments` and `globalArguments` are additive console projections: the
former starts at the subcommand, and the latter contains temporary configuration
as `-c key=value` pairs followed by the original global argument prefix. Consoles
fold contiguous `-c` pairs at their original positions; other global arguments
stay visible. Raw `arguments` remain authoritative for copying and diagnostics. Older events without projections retain their legacy display.
Visible workflow commands and explicit `git.command` requests produce execution
events. Internal read-only queries remain silent in the console while retaining
normal workflow capture and result semantics. Missing optional config values retain their
actual exit 1 with `expectedExit: true`; only the executing workflow can mark that
normal result. Other nonzero exits and request errors remain failures. The
`remoteResult` event carries the transfer's `invocationId` so later inspection
queries cannot acquire its summary. Final command response semantics remain unchanged.

A complete line is redacted before publication. Native diagnostic limits are
16 KiB per line, 512 KiB raw diagnostic input and 4,096 output events per
invocation. Limits produce an omission record without suppressing completion.
Raw parser capture has an independent 32 MiB per-stream bound and fails on
overflow. See `shared/fixtures/git/execution-events-v1.json`.

`git.write` accepts a typed mutation request. Its required `operation` values are
`stage`, `unstage`, `discard`, `discardAll`, `stageAll`, `commit`, `ignore`, `exclude`, `cherryPick`, `revert`,
`reset`, `undoCommit`, `editCommitMessage`, `deleteCommit`, `squashCommits`, `createBranch`, `publishBranch`,
`renameBranch`, `setUpstream`, `unsetUpstream`, `deleteBranch`, `updateBranch`, `merge`, `rebase`, `createWorktree`,
`removeWorktree`, `lockWorktree`, `unlockWorktree`, `repairWorktrees`, `pruneWorktrees`,
`fetch`, `pull`, `push`, `checkout`, `checkoutAndRebase`, `checkoutRevision`, `clone`, `stashPush`,
`stashApply`, `stashPop`, `stashDrop`, `deleteRemoteBranch`, `operationContinue`,
`operationAbort`, `operationSkip`, `createTag`, and `deleteTag`. Optional fields are `paths`, `reference`, `referenceKind`,
`gitReference`, `revision`, `revisions`, `name`, `message`, `remote`, `destination`, `mode`,
`includeUntracked`, `checkout`, `amend`, `force`, `pushTags`, `expectedPush`, `autoStash`,
`worktreeMode`, `noCheckout`, `expectedBranch`, and `expectedState`. The four history actions require the reviewed `expectedState`
described below; earlier unreviewed history-write callers must migrate.

`pull` optionally accepts `expectedBranch` as a complete local `refs/heads/*`
identity for a background update whose host has already fetched. Core pins that
branch's fetched upstream commit and integrates it with local `merge --ff-only`,
`merge --no-edit`, or `rebase`, avoiding a second network wait in `git pull`.
It verifies symbolic HEAD under the repository writer lease before resolving the
upstream and again before integration; a different branch or detached HEAD fails
with `invalid_request` and does not integrate. Explicit source references and
auto-stash are incompatible with this guarded mode. Other operations reject this field. Omission preserves
existing clients. Hosts should also recheck the selected worktree after Fetch and
before invoking the guarded update, reporting `state-changed` if the checkout changed while
the request was waiting. The lease serializes Lithe writes, not external Git
clients; the final check reduces the gap and is not an external checkout lock.

The core validates pathspecs, revisions, branch names, references, reset modes,
stash references, and operation-specific required fields before invoking Git.
`setUpstream` requires a typed remote `gitReference` and passes its complete
`refs/remotes/*` identity to Git, so a same-named local branch cannot make the
upstream ambiguous. `createWorktree` accepts `worktreeMode` values `newBranch`
(the backward-compatible default), `existingBranch`, and `detached`.
`newBranch` requires `name` and a typed `gitReference`, with an optional
`revision` override. A remote base without a revision override uses one
`git worktree add --track -b` mutation so creation and tracking have one Git
outcome. Explicit revisions resolve to immutable OIDs and use `--no-track`;
local and tag bases also use `--no-track`, independently of
`branch.autoSetupMerge`. `existingBranch`
requires a typed local branch and rejects `name` and `revision`; it passes the
validated branch identity without `-b`, leaving Git to reject an already
occupied branch. `detached` rejects `name` and requires a typed reference or
`revision` (the latter takes precedence), resolves it to an immutable commit,
and uses `--detach`. Independent `noCheckout: true` adds `--no-checkout` in
every mode; its default is false, and legacy `checkout` does not control
worktree file population. Examples are in
`shared/fixtures/git/worktree-creation-v1.json`. Worktree mutations re-read Git's
registered list and reject arbitrary paths. Removal rejects the current,
primary, or locked worktree; dirty worktrees require an explicit `force` value.
`repairWorktrees` refreshes administrative links after a repository or worktree
has moved. `pruneWorktrees` removes registrations whose checkout is already missing and
does not recursively delete an arbitrary directory.

`updateBranch` requires a typed, non-current local `gitReference`. Core resolves
that branch's configured remote upstream and performs an atomic Fetch that
refreshes the remote-tracking ref and fast-forwards the local branch without
switching HEAD. Git rejects diverged branches and branches checked out by any
worktree, so the operation cannot discard local commits or mutate another active
checkout.
Successful process launch returns `{ "arguments": string[], "output": string,
"stdout": string, "stderr": string, "exitCode": number, "invocations":
GitCommandInvocation[], "operationError": CoreError?, "stashRestore":
GitStashRestore?, "historyRewrite": GitHistoryRewriteResult?, "warnings": GitOperationWarning[] }`
even when Git exits non-zero.
`GitOperationWarning` is `{ "code": string, "message": string, "details"?: string }`
and reports a non-fatal follow-up failure after the requested mutation already
succeeded. Platform clients must retain the successful operation outcome while
presenting the warning. The top-level process fields
normally describe the final subprocess, and `output` is that subprocess's
`stdout` followed by `stderr`. `invocations` records every Git subprocess for
composite operations such as `discardAll` and Smart Checkout in execution
order; each item contains the exact argument vector (excluding the executable
name), separate streams, and exit code. A follow-up validation or probe failure
after Git has started is returned in `operationError` alongside the retained
trace. A stash restore conflict is a logical operation failure represented by
`stashRestore`, even when a later diagnostic invocation exits successfully.
Consumers must therefore consider `operationError` and `stashRestore` in
addition to the compatibility `exitCode`. The shared compatibility fixtures are
`shared/fixtures/git/command-response-v1.json` and
`shared/fixtures/git/command-error-response-v1.json`. Invalid arguments found
before any Git subprocess use the standard `invalid_request` error envelope.
`checkout` uses `referenceKind` values
`local`, `remote`, or `tag`; `clone` uses `remote` as its source and
`destination` as its target path. `publishBranch` validates `name`, creates
and checks out that branch at a detached HEAD when needed, then pushes it with
an upstream. If the push fails, the local branch is intentionally retained so
the user can fix credentials or connectivity and retry without losing commits.

`git.pushPreview` accepts `root`, an optional complete local `gitReference` or
legacy `reference`, an optional bounded `limit`, and `pushTags`. It returns `localBranch`,
`localHead`, `remote`, `remoteBranch`, nullable `remoteTrackingOid`, nullable
`upstream`, exact reviewed `tags`, `commits`, and `hasMore` using
`shared/fixtures/git/push-preview-v1.json`. The push destination follows
`branch.<name>.pushRemote`, then `remote.pushDefault`, the configured upstream
remote, `branch.<name>.remote`, and finally `origin` or the first configured
remote. A destination without a fetched tracking reference previews commits not
reachable from that remote. A reviewed `push` mutation sends these resolved fields
back as `expectedPush`; Core rejects a stale local tip, destination, or tracking OID
before starting Git. `force` binds `--force-with-lease` to the reviewed destination
OID when `expectedPush` is present, and Core also validates the reviewed tag
identities; `pushTags` accepts `none`, `all`, or `reachable`
and maps to no tag option, `--tags`, or `--follow-tags` respectively. Legacy push
callers may omit `expectedPush`. A reviewed push uses the preview's immutable
`localHead` OID as the refspec source, so a repository change after validation
cannot add unreviewed commits to the operation. Because Git cannot infer an
upstream from an OID source, Core explicitly configures the reviewed local
branch after a successful first push.

New reference-based workflows send `gitReference` as `{ "fullName": string,
"shortName": string, "kind": "local" | "remote" | "tag" }`. Core verifies
that all three fields describe the same namespace and validates the full ref
with Git. The legacy `reference` and `referenceKind` fields remain accepted for
existing platform calls. `checkoutAndRebase` requires a local or remote branch
reference and a completely clean worktree; Core records the current local
branch before switching and rebases the checked-out branch onto that original
branch. A dirty tree or detached HEAD is rejected before checkout begins. When
remote checkout finds an existing same-named local branch, Core uses it only if
its configured upstream is the selected complete remote reference.

`pull` without an explicit reference retains current-upstream behavior. An
explicit remote reference may use either the preferred `gitReference` shape or
the legacy `reference` plus `referenceKind: "remote"` fields. Core validates and
safely splits `refs/remotes/<remote>/<branch>` against configured remote names,
then invokes pull with the explicit remote and branch using `mode` `ffOnly`,
`merge`, or `rebase`. Platforms must not parse the remote reference or construct
these Git arguments themselves.

`deleteRemoteBranch` requires a complete remote `gitReference`. Core resolves
the configured remote with longest-prefix matching and invokes a structured
remote branch deletion; platforms must not split `shortName` themselves.

When `commit` includes `paths`, Core stages the complete working-tree state of
those paths, including untracked files and deletions, then commits only those
paths. Other paths already present in the index remain staged and are not part
of the new commit. Core checks conflict markers after preparing that final
snapshot in an isolated temporary index initialized from the operation's HEAD
tree. The real index is not changed on any
staging, validation, hook, signing, or commit failure; successful commits
reconcile only the selected paths, preserving unrelated staging created while
the operation ran. Selected paths used to prepare and reconcile the snapshot
are passed to Git over NUL-delimited stdin with `--pathspec-from-file`, avoiding
platform command-line limits and preserving rename source/destination identity.
`git.diff` accepts `worktreeSnapshot: true` to review that same complete
working-tree snapshot against `HEAD` through an isolated temporary index. This
mode includes staged, unstaged, untracked, deleted, and same-path recreated
files without reading or mutating the real index and cannot be combined with
other diff reference modes.
A `commit` request without `paths` retains
the legacy behavior of committing the existing index. `ignore` appends root-anchored patterns to the
repository's top-level `.gitignore`; `exclude` appends the same patterns to the
worktree-aware Git metadata path for `info/exclude`. Both ignore operations
preserve existing content, escape Git pattern characters, de-duplicate rules,
and interpret a trailing `/` as a directory rule.

`editCommitMessage` rebuilds the selected commit and its later first-parent
descendants with the new `message`. `squashCommits` requires at least two
distinct, contiguous `revisions`, uses the newest selected tree, and rebuilds
later descendants. Both preserve commit author and committer attribution and
atomically update the checked-out branch reference. `deleteCommit` drops a
non-root commit and replays later commits; deleting HEAD resets to its parent.
All three operations reject a dirty worktree, detached HEAD, an active Git
operation, a target outside the current branch's first-parent chain, a rewrite
range containing a merge commit, or any rewritten commit reachable from
`refs/remotes`. They also reject any signed commit in the affected range, so
the existing unsigned `commit-tree` execution cannot silently strip a signature.
Their complete messages must be UTF-8. Root-commit message edits and squash
ranges that include the root remain supported; root deletion is rejected.

`undoCommit` accepts one `revision` that must resolve to the checked-out local
branch's HEAD with exactly one parent. It atomically moves that branch to the
parent while preserving the index bytes and working files, including existing
staged, unstaged, and untracked edits. It rejects root and merge commits,
detached HEAD, unresolved conflicts, an active Git operation, and a HEAD known
to be reachable from remote-tracking refs. Undo may preserve a signed HEAD
because it moves a ref without reconstructing or modifying that commit object.

Native interactive rebases use the dedicated preview/start/session/control
contract in [git-rebase-session.md](git-rebase-session.md). The base selected
for “Rebase from Here” remains unchanged; only its successors are rewritten.

`git.historyRewritePreview` accepts `{ "root": string, "operation": string,
"revisions": string[] }` for those four operations. It returns `operation`,
`allowed`, `blockers` (`{ "code": string, "message": string }[]`), nullable
`branch` and `head`, `selectedCommits`, `affectedCommits`, `suggestedMessage`,
and nullable `expectedState`. Each commit has a full `hash`, `parents`, and its
complete, untrimmed `message`; both commit lists are oldest first, independently
of UI sorting, filtering, or pagination. Squash's suggested message combines
all selected messages in that order. The preview permits at most 1000 affected
commits; an out-of-range selection is explicitly blocked rather than truncated.
`affectedCommits` covers later descendants whose OIDs change as well as the
selection. Remote reachability uses local `refs/remotes`, including descendants;
it is not a live server claim that a commit has never been published.

An actionable preview contains `expectedState` as `{ "branch": string,
"head": string, "stateToken": string, "operation": string, "revisions": string[] }`.
Callers return this object unchanged in `git.write`, using its selected full
OIDs in the normal `revision` or `revisions` fields. The optional edited
`message` is separately validated without silently trimming its contents.
Core normalizes subdirectory roots to the repository root. Its opaque token
covers checkout identity and symbolic HEAD, local/remote/tag refs, exact index
contents, working-file diffs, untracked-file contents, and active operation
state. Core repeats eligibility and snapshot checks before preparation and
again before the expected-OID ref update. Changed previews fail with
`invalid_request` and a stale-preview message. Typed Git writers, including
index patch operations, share a repository-wide in-process lease across linked
worktrees; external Git writers remain subject to snapshot and OID checks.

Before altering the branch, Core creates a persistent ref beneath
`refs/lithe/history-recovery/` at the original HEAD. Its reflog records the
operation, original branch and HEAD so the point remains attributable after a
process restart. At most the newest 20 recovery refs are retained after
successful cleanup; cleanup failure is explicit. These internal refs are
excluded from ordinary reference lists and unfiltered Git history, including
decorations. A host can use the recovery OID/ref with the existing `createBranch`
operation to preserve or inspect the old history without resetting working files.

After a recovery point exists, the response retains `historyRewrite` as
`{ "operation": string, "branch": string, "originalHead": string, "newHead":
string | null, "recoveryReference": string, "mutationApplied": boolean,
"outcomeKnown": boolean, "worktreeRefresh": "notNeeded" | "ready" | "failed" }`.
`newHead` is the prepared target when one exists, even if its installation failed.
`mutationApplied` is true only after successful installation or observation;
when interrupted outcome inspection also fails, `outcomeKnown` is false and
the user must inspect recovery before retrying. Clients must not infer that
nothing happened from a cancellation or generic error. Drop replays against an
isolated index before moving the ref; replay failure leaves real checkout state
unchanged. After a successful ref update, a guarded two-tree checkout refresh
does not move HEAD again. Refresh failure yields `git_worktree_refresh_failed`
while preserving `mutationApplied: true` and the recovery point. For these
structured responses, compatibility process fields describe the authoritative
mutation result instead of a later recovery-cleanup subprocess; diagnostics
remain available in `invocations`, `operationError`, and `warnings`.
The compatibility fixture is `shared/fixtures/git/history-rewrite-v1.json`.

`createTag` uses `name` for the new tag, `revision` as its target commit or
revision, and an optional `message`: when the field is present (including an
empty value), it creates an annotated tag (`git tag -a`); an absent field
creates a lightweight tag. UI callers trim new user-entered messages. Core
passes the supplied annotation with verbatim cleanup so restore preserves
CRLF and trailing blank lines, and an explicit empty value preserves an empty
annotated tag. Tag names must satisfy the `git check-ref-format` refname rules and must not
begin with a dash; `shared/fixtures/git/tag-names.json` pins the boundary cases
for Core and host-side validation. Before invoking Git, `createTag` probes the
repository so a duplicate tag (`A tag named '<name>' already exists`) and an unresolvable
non-commit target (`Could not resolve tag target '<rev>'`) fail with stable
`invalid_request` messages instead of localized Git output. `deleteTag` uses
`name` and removes `refs/tags/<name>`; a missing tag fails with
`The tag '<name>' does not exist`. On success the response carries a
structured `tagDeletion` record — `{ "name": string, "deletedTarget": string,
"kind": "lightweight" | "annotated", "message": string? }` — where
`deletedTarget` is the peeled commit the deleted ref resolved to and
`message` is the original annotation with its line breaks preserved. Hosts
can rebuild the tag by replaying `createTag` with `name`, `deletedTarget`,
and `message`; the tagger identity and timestamp are intentionally not
preserved. Deletion supplies the observed unpeeled object ID to `update-ref`,
so a concurrent force-update fails atomically instead of deleting new state and
returning a stale recovery target. `deleteBranch` applies the same expected-OID
guard after checking the branch is fully merged and not checked out, then
on success, carries a structured `branchDeletion` record —
`{ "name": string, "deletedTarget": string }` — so hosts can offer to
recreate the branch at its previous commit; a missing branch fails with
`The branch '<name>' does not exist`. If the ref deletion succeeds but branch
configuration cleanup fails, the response contains both `branchDeletion` and a
`branch_config_cleanup_failed` warning; hosts must preserve the Restore action while surfacing the
cleanup diagnostic.

`operationContinue`, `operationAbort`, and `operationSkip` inspect Git metadata
to select the active merge, rebase, cherry-pick, or revert instead of accepting
an operation kind from the caller. Continue is rejected while conflicted paths
remain, and skip is supported only for a rebase. All three return the normal
Git process result when Git is invoked;
an absent or unsupported operation state uses the `invalid_request` envelope.

`git.checkoutPreflight` accepts `{ "root": string, "reference": string }` or
the preferred `{ "root": string, "gitReference": GitReference }` shape and
returns `{ "blockingPaths": string[] }`. The sorted, de-duplicated result
contains tracked paths that are both locally modified and different between
HEAD and the target, plus untracked paths that the target reference tracks.

`git.pullPreflight` accepts `{ "root": string }` and returns `upstream` as a
string or `null`, numeric `ahead` and `behind` counts, `diverged`, and
`hasLocalChanges`. It reads the existing tracking reference without fetching;
`diverged` is true only when both counts are non-zero. `hasLocalChanges` checks
tracked changes and excludes untracked files. A branch with no configured
upstream returns `null`, zero counts, and false for both booleans.

`git.integrationPreflight` accepts either `reference` or `gitReference` with
`root` and `operation`, where `operation` is `merge`, `rebase`, `cherryPick`,
or `revert`. It returns sorted, de-duplicated `blockingPaths` and
`blocksEntirely`. Merge, cherry-pick, and revert report only dirty tracked paths
that overlap files the operation would write. Rebase reports every dirty
tracked path and sets `blocksEntirely` to true when that set is non-empty.

`git.conflictMarkers` accepts `{ "root": string }` and returns
`{ "paths": string[] }`. Paths are sorted and de-duplicated staged text files
whose staged content has a line beginning with an opening, closing, or diff3
conflict marker. A bare
`=======` line is not treated as a conflict marker.

`git.operationState` accepts `{ "root": string }` and returns `kind`,
`reference`, `step`, `total`, and sorted, de-duplicated `conflictedPaths`.
`kind` is an empty string when no operation is active; otherwise it is `merge`,
`rebase`, `cherryPick`, or `revert`. `reference`, `step`, and `total` are
nullable, and the progress counters are populated only for a rebase. State is
read from Git's own metadata, so operations started outside Lithe are reported.

`git.diff` accepts `root`, `pathspecs`, optional `reference`, `gitReference`,
`targetGitReference`, or `commit`, plus `emptyTreeBase` for a legacy target
reference whose comparison must begin at the repository's object-format-specific empty tree,
`staged`, `untracked`, `contextLines`, and `ignoreAllWhitespace`, and returns `{ "patch": string, "rows": [],
"hunks": [] }`. Rows contain one-based `oldLine`/`newLine` values where
available, `left`/`right` text, a `kind` (`context`, `changed`, `addition`,
`removal`, or `information`), and an optional `hunkID`. For `context` and
`information` rows both sides carry identical text, so `right` is omitted and
clients must fall back to `left`. Hunk entries contain their header and the
patch text needed for partial apply; rows are not duplicated per hunk, so
clients group `rows` by `hunkID` instead.
New reference-tree workflows use `gitReference`; Core validates its full
identity before constructing the diff invocation. When `targetGitReference` is
present, Core validates both complete identities and constructs the two-ref
range. The legacy `reference` field remains available for existing revision and
range comparisons.

`git.comparison` accepts `root` plus the same `reference` or `gitReference` /
`targetGitReference` forms and returns the deterministically ordered changed
files. Platforms must not construct a two-ref range themselves.
`git.apply` accepts `root`, `patch`, and `mode`; supported modes are `stage`,
`unstage`, `discard`, `restoreIndex`, `worktree`, `restoreIndexCheck`, and
`worktreeCheck`. The two `*Check` modes only test whether the reverse patch
already applies, so Shelf restoration can be retried after a partial failure.
It returns the normal Git process result. `restoreIndex` applies a saved
index patch to both the index and worktree; `worktree` applies only to the
worktree. Pathspecs must be workspace-relative and must not contain absolute
paths or `..` components.

`git.history` accepts `root`, an optional full `reference`, and `limit` (the
core clamps it to `1...5000`). It remains the compatibility command that
combines `git.references` with the first `git.historyPage`. New clients use
`git.references` with `{ "root": string }` and request commits separately with
`git.historyPage` using `root`, optional full `reference`, nullable opaque
`cursor`, `limit`, and optional `order` (`"topo"` or `"date"`). Omitted
`order` preserves the original `git log --topo-order` behavior. `"date"` uses
`git log --date-order`: committer date descending whenever the child-before-
parent constraint permits, independently of the displayed author date. macOS
and Windows Git Log request date order for their pages and repository graph;
other clients that omit the field retain topology order. A cursor is bound to its root, reference, and order;
continuations must repeat the same order. A mismatched order returns
`invalid_request` without consuming the cursor. The portable request example is
`shared/fixtures/git/history-page-date-request-v1.json`.
The first request omits `cursor`; each later request
returns the prior page's `nextCursor`. Core keeps one bounded, backpressured
`git log` stream behind that cursor and clamps the stream to the first 5,000
commits, so later pages continue traversal instead of replaying earlier commits.
A history page returns `commits`, nullable `nextCursor`, and `hasMore`. Clients
call `git.historyCursorClose` with `root` and `cursor` when abandoning an
unfinished stream, and discard and close a late page when its repository,
selected reference, or owning `operationId` is stale. Core also expires idle
cursors and caps the number of live streams. Commit parents are explicit so
clients can render merge topology without re-parsing Git output. The optional
effective `userName` and `userEmail` returned by `git.references` let clients
implement a stable `me` filter without guessing from recent commits. Each
reference includes `peelsToCommit`; hosts use it to disable commit-only
actions for legal tree/blob tags before the user reaches a failing mutation.
Each local
reference with an upstream also returns numeric `ahead` and `behind` counts
against that fetched remote-tracking reference. A restricted remote fetch refspec
must not hide an explicitly configured `branch.<name>.remote` / `merge` relationship
when its conventional remote-tracking ref exists. The reference snapshot resolves
missing metadata using invocation-only Git configuration; it does not change
repository fetch settings, guess tracking from matching names, or fetch remotely.
References without an upstream,
remote references, and tags return zero for both fields. Portable examples are
`shared/fixtures/git/references-response-v1.json` and
`shared/fixtures/git/history-page-response-v1.json`.

For compatibility, a request that explicitly contains the deprecated numeric
`offset` field still uses the bounded offset implementation and returns
`nextOffset`; it honors the same optional `order`. New clients must omit
`offset`; repository size does not select
between the two protocols.

`git.commit` accepts `root` and a revision, returning one `commit` object with
the same fields as a history page entry and a `body` string. `body` is the
message after the subject paragraph (Git `%b`), keeps internal line breaks and
indentation, has trailing whitespace removed, and is empty for a subject-only
message. History pages carry only `subject`; a commit detail view reads the
body on demand with `git.commit`. See
`shared/fixtures/git/commit-lookup-response-v1.json`.
`git.blame` accepts `root` and a workspace-relative `path`; its line numbers
are one-based and author timestamps are Unix seconds.

`workspace.search` accepts `maxResults` for a total result cap. Callers that
need separate buckets may also provide `maxFileResults` and
`maxContentResults`; each category is capped independently and the total cap
still applies.

`workspace.searchEverywhere` uses the same query options and visibility fields,
and additionally accepts `maxSymbolResults`. Results are ordered as file,
type, symbol, and content matches. Java type and method results include a
one-based line, `symbolName`, and the matching source line in `preview`.

`workspace.replacePreview` accepts `root`, `query`, `replacement`, the same
query options, optional workspace-relative `paths`, optional `textOverrides`
keyed by relative path, and visibility fields. It returns `{ "files": [] }`
where each file contains replacement matches and the complete
`replacementText` to write. The command never writes files; callers can record
history before using `file.write` for the selected files.

`lsp.applyTextEdits` accepts `{ "text": string, "edits": [] }`, where each edit
has an LSP range with zero-based `line` and UTF-16 `utf16Column` fields plus
`newText`. Ranges are validated and overlapping edits return
`invalid_request` with details `overlappingEdits`; invalid positions return
details `invalidRange`. Successful responses return `{ "text": string }`.

`lsp.plainSnippet` accepts `{ "value": string }` and returns `{ "text": string }`
after removing LSP tab stops and replacing simple placeholder defaults such as
`${1:name}` with `name`.


`editor.lineEdit` applies one deterministic line-level transform. All offsets
are UTF-16 code units so both hosts can feed the result straight into their
text engines. The payload is `{ "operation": "toggleLineComment" |
"duplicateLine" | "deleteLine" | "moveLineUp" | "moveLineDown" | "copyLineUp" |
"copyLineDown", "source": string, "selectionStart": 0, "selectionLength": 0,
"commentToken": "//" }`. `selectionStart` and `selectionLength` are clamped
into the document. `commentToken` is required by `toggleLineComment` and
rejected with `invalid_request` otherwise. The response is
`{ "applied": true, "text": "...", "replacedStart": 0, "replacedLength": 9,
"selectionStart": 8, "selectionLength": 0 }` where `text` replaces
`[replacedStart, replacedStart + replacedLength)` and `selection` is the range
to restore. `applied: false` with every other field omitted marks a legitimate
no-op such as moving the first line up; callers must leave their text view
unchanged and must not consume the keyboard shortcut.

`editor.lineCommentToken` accepts `{ "identifier": "py" }` (case
insensitive; the identifier may be a file extension, a file name including
dotfiles such as `.env`, or a language id — extensions, dotfile basenames,
and language ids share one table) and returns `{ "token": "#" }` or
`{ "token": null }` for file types without a line comment token.

macOS consumes both commands today. Windows still uses its local TypeScript
implementations (`comment-toggle.ts`, `line-operations.ts`) and is expected
to adopt the same contract in a follow-up change; the fixture pins the
canonical behavior for that migration. Deterministic cases are pinned by
`shared/fixtures/editor/line-edit-v1.json`.

The `debug.*` commands are the shared Debug Adapter Protocol boundary. Rust
owns DAP framing, request sequences, response correlation, initialization and
execution state, deterministic breakpoint sets, and normalized thread, stack,
scope, variable, evaluation, output, stop, continue, and termination events.
Platforms own adapter discovery, JDT LS activation, sockets or process pipes,
native process termination, persistence, and UI rendering.

`debug.createSession` accepts `{ sessionId, adapterId, rootPath,
supportsRunInTerminalRequest }`. It does not
open a socket or launch a process. It returns a session update in
`initializing` state with an ordered `outboundFrames` array. Each frame is a
complete Content-Length-framed byte sequence encoded as base64. Every Debug
command returns the same update shape: `{ sessionId, state, outboundFrames,
events }`. The platform writes frames in array order and feeds received chunks
back through `debug.receive` as `{ sessionId, dataBase64 }`; partial and
consecutive messages are buffered and reduced in Rust.

When `supportsRunInTerminalRequest` is true, the initialize frame advertises
the native host's terminal capability. An adapter `runInTerminal` reverse
request becomes a deterministic `runInTerminalRequested` event containing a
Core-generated `requestId`, terminal kind, title, working directory, ordered
argument vector, sorted environment changes, and shell-interpretation flag.
The platform launches the process through its PTY/ConPTY adapter and calls
`debug.runInTerminalResponse` with `{ sessionId, requestId, success, processId?,
shellProcessId?, message? }`. Core validates process identifiers, emits the DAP
response, ignores duplicate or expired completions, and fails pending terminal
requests when the session disconnects. The shared compatibility cases are in
`shared/fixtures/debug/run-in-terminal-v1.json`.

`debug.launch` accepts an `operationId` and a language-neutral configuration
containing `name`, request kind (`launch` or `attach`), provider arguments, and
optional portable `steppingFilters`.
`debug.javaTestLaunch` accepts JDT LS-owned working directory, main class,
project, classpath, module path, VM arguments, program arguments, Java test
framework, and a platform-owned loopback result port. JUnit placeholder ports
are replaced deterministically. TestNG appends the packaged runner once and
uses its selected method names. Core serializes JDT's VM and program argument
arrays into the string fields required by Java Debug Server's DAP launch model.
JDT LS remains responsible for resolving file,
class, and method selections to this metadata; Core does not parse Java source
or infer a test framework in this command. The command creates no process,
socket, timer, or persistent session; compatibility cases live in
`shared/fixtures/debug/java-test-launch-v1.json`.
Launch submitted during initialization is retained until the initialize
response. For Java, Core projects those filters into the adapter's `stepFilters`
launch object unless the provider arguments already contain an explicit value.
`debug.steppingFilters` accepts `{ adapterId, filters? }`; omission of `filters`
returns deterministic adapter defaults, while a supplied value is trimmed,
sorted, de-duplicated, and validated before persistence or launch. Omitted
fields inside a supplied value are empty or false, so future adapters never
inherit Java policy accidentally. Java class
patterns support `$JDK`, `$Libraries`, and adapter-compatible wildcards. Other
adapters default to an unfiltered policy until their integration defines one.
Java defaults include both `$JDK` and `$Libraries`, matching the IDE convention
of collapsing platform and dependency frames while retaining project frames.
The portable cases are in
`shared/fixtures/debug/stepping-filters-v1.json`.

Normalized stack frames include `isFiltered`. Core derives it from the active
class filters using the DAP frame name, source path, presentation hint, and
session root. This classification is presentation metadata only: Core returns
the complete ordered stack, while native UIs may collapse consecutive matching
frames and must allow users to expand them. `debug.setBreakpoints` accepts
one-based line and optional column,
enabled state, condition, hit condition, and log message values. Rust sorts and
de-duplicates the complete source set, retains disabled entries without sending
them to the adapter, waits for the DAP `initialized` event, then sends all
sources in deterministic path order followed by `configurationDone` when the
adapter supports it. This allows native products to mute or restore breakpoints
without maintaining a second protocol representation.

`debug.setExceptionBreakpoints` accepts adapter-defined filter identifiers,
enabled state, and an optional condition. Rust trims, sorts, and de-duplicates
the complete selection, retains disabled filters without sending them, and uses
DAP `filterOptions` only when the adapter negotiated that capability. Before a
native client has configured a selection, Rust adopts the adapter's declared
defaults so the first `initialized` flow sends exception filters before source
breakpoints and `configurationDone`.

`debug.setFunctionBreakpoints` accepts a method or function name, enabled
state, condition, and hit condition. Rust retains the complete sorted set,
omits disabled entries, and sends DAP `setFunctionBreakpoints` before source
breakpoints only when the adapter negotiated function-breakpoint support.

Data breakpoints use DAP's required two-step flow. The native client first calls
`debug.dataBreakpointInfo` with the selected variable name plus its parent
`variablesReference` and current frame. Rust Core correlates the response by
`operationId` and returns the adapter-owned `dataId`, display description,
allowed access modes, and `canPersist`. The client then calls
`debug.setDataBreakpoints`; Core keeps the complete deterministic set, omits
disabled entries, and sends access type, condition, and hit count only when the
adapter negotiated data-breakpoint support. Native clients must discard IDs
whose `canPersist` is false when the debug session ends.

`debug.setVariable` accepts the selected variable's parent `variablesReference`,
name, and replacement text. Core permits mutation only while paused and after
the adapter advertises `supportsSetVariable`, then returns the adapter's
normalized replacement value and optional type through the caller's
`operationId`.

`debug.execute` covers continue, pause, step over, step in, step out, step back,
restart, terminate, and capability-gated single-thread execution. Rust Core rejects stepping unless the session is paused
and a thread is selected, and gates step back, restart, and terminate against
the adapter capabilities negotiated during initialization. Restart and
terminate are session-level requests and never receive a stale `threadId`.
Single-thread pause, continue, and stepping preserve the paused session when
the adapter reports that other threads remain stopped.

`debug.cancelOperation` removes the matching pending request before emitting a
terminal failure, so a late adapter response cannot mutate current UI state. If
the adapter advertises `supportsCancelRequest`, Core also sends DAP `cancel`
with the original request sequence. Native hosts own monotonic deadlines and
invoke this command with `cancelled` or `timedOut`; the macOS reference product
uses a bounded 10-second deadline for interactive inspections and mutations.

Smart step into and run to cursor keep DAP's target lookup explicit. Clients
use `debug.inspect` with `stepInTargets` and a frame, or `gotoTargets` with a
source path and one-based cursor coordinates. Core normalizes the returned
targets and correlates them to the caller's operation. The selected target is
then passed as `targetId` to `debug.execute` using `stepIn` or `goto`; both
flows are rejected unless the adapter advertised the matching capability.

The successful DAP initialize response emits a normalized `capabilities` event.
It includes conditional, hit-count, log, function, data, and exception
breakpoint support; variable mutation; restart and terminate requests; step
back; exception information; request cancellation; single-thread execution;
step-in targets; goto targets; and ordered exception filters. Native UIs
must treat capability state as unknown until this event arrives and hide or
disable unsupported actions after negotiation.

`debug.execute` correlates continue, pause, next, step-in, and step-out to the
caller's `operationId`. `debug.inspect` supports `threads`, `stackTrace`,
`scopes`, `variables`, `evaluate`, and capability-gated `exceptionInfo`;
required thread, frame, variable reference, and expression fields are validated
before a request is emitted. A `variables` inspection may additionally carry
`variableFilter` (`named` or `indexed`), zero-based `start`, and positive
`count`; Core maps them to DAP `filter`, `start`, and `count` and rejects those
fields for every other inspection kind. Normalized scopes, variables,
evaluations, and variable-mutation results include non-negative
`namedVariables` and `indexedVariables` counts, using zero when the adapter
omits or reports an invalid negative value. The compatibility cases are in
`shared/fixtures/debug/variable-paging-v1.json`.

Exception information is available only while
paused and normalizes the exception type, description, break mode, optional
stack trace, evaluation name, and nested exception details. The Java adapter
currently supplies the type, description, and break mode but no expandable
exception object reference, so native clients continue to inspect ordinary
frame scopes for local state.
Terminal operation events are exactly one of `operationCompleted` with a typed
result or `operationFailed` with the adapter command and safe message. Other
ordered events are `stateChanged`, `initialized`, `output`, `stopped`,
`continued`, `terminated`, and `breakpoint`. Source coordinates are one-based.
The compatibility flow is captured in
`shared/fixtures/debug/dap-session-v1.json`; exception normalization cases are
captured in `shared/fixtures/debug/exception-info-v1.json`.

`debug.disconnect` emits the protocol handshake and enters `terminating`.
Core derives DAP `terminateDebuggee` from the session's request kind: `launch`
uses `true`, while `attach` and a session stopped before either request use
`false`. This prevents a remote detach from killing a JVM the IDE does not own.
The compatibility cases are in
`shared/fixtures/debug/disconnect-policy-v1.json`. The platform keeps the
socket or process alive long enough to flush the frame, then closes it and
calls `debug.destroySession`. A session allocates no process, socket, timer, or
background task, and no session exists until Debug is used.

`lsp.builtinCompletions`, `lsp.builtinHover`, and `lsp.builtinNavigation` are
the no-process lightweight language path. They accept current-file text, an
absolute `filePath`, and a zero-based LSP position. Completion returns
current-file identifiers with text edits for the active prefix. Hover returns
the current identifier as markdown. Navigation returns current-file locations;
definition prefers declaration-looking occurrences, while references returns
all matching identifier occurrences. These commands are deliberately
text-level fallbacks; precise type-aware behavior belongs to a started language
server.

The LSP provider catalog is returned by `lithe_core_lsp_provider_catalog_json`.
Each provider descriptor may include `languageServerLaunch` with ordered
`executableNames` and `arguments`; Swift adapters use this metadata when they
need to discover a real language-server executable; the selected launch plan is
then submitted to the Rust-owned runtime. Built-in descriptors are merged by provider ID with the optional
`.lithe/lsp/language-providers.json` workspace document. See
[`.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-13-language-tooling-and-lsp-runtime-ownership.md`](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-13-language-tooling-and-lsp-runtime-ownership.md)
for routing, discovery, lifecycle, and compatibility rules.

The `lsp.*Server`, `lsp.*Document`, `lsp.request`, `lsp.pollEvents`, and
`lsp.waitEvents`
commands are the semantic LSP runtime boundary. `lsp.startServer` accepts the
provider ID, selected executable/arguments/environment, root URI, working
directory, initialization options, optional runtime executable,
`jdtlsLaunchResources`, cache directory, and `workspaceFingerprint`, plus
initialize, post-initialize readiness, request, Java project build
(`javaBuildTimeoutMilliseconds`), and shutdown deadlines.
Java callers may also provide the versioned `mavenContext` accepted by
`maven.launchPlan`. Core validates its reactor and recursively declared modules,
publishes the user-level settings through
`java.configuration.maven.userSettings` and the selected installation's
`conf/settings.xml` through `java.configuration.maven.globalSettings`, and,
after `ServiceReady`, sends one
`java.project.updateSettings` command per Maven project with
`org.eclipse.m2e.core.selectedProfiles`. Maven Java, test, and generated source
roots are normalized to workspace-relative `java.project.sourcePaths` during
the same configuration flow, so JDT LS receives the selected reactor's source
model without platform-specific POM parsing. Both settings documents are passed as content-addressed copies inside the
session's JDT LS state directory (`<data>/.lithe/maven/`). The user-level copy
comes from `settingsPath`, else Maven's default `~/.m2/settings.xml`, else an
empty document when only `localRepositoryPath` is set, and carries that local
repository override. JDT LS detects settings changes by comparing paths, so a
content change must always produce a new path. An unreadable document is passed
by its original path with a session warning instead of failing startup.
Copies remain readable until JDT workspace cache eviction or index rebuilding;
notification delivery is not an acknowledgement that the server read them.

`lsp.updateMavenConfiguration` accepts `{ sessionId, mavenContext,
reloadProjects? }` for a running Java session started with a `mavenContext`,
and returns `{ settingsChanged, projectsReloaded, profilesUpdating }`. When the
settings copies differ from the ones JDT LS holds, Core sends
`workspace/didChangeConfiguration` and JDT LS force-updates every Maven project
itself. When they are unchanged and `reloadProjects` is `true`, Core sends
`java/projectConfigurationsUpdate` for the reactor's project URIs, which
re-resolves dependencies even though no `pom.xml` changed. Changed profiles
restart the profile task once the session is ready. Before the `initialized`
handshake, the new configuration replaces the one the pending settings
notification sends. Explicit reloads received before `ServiceReady` are coalesced
and sent once projects are ready, even when settings are unchanged. Response
booleans describe actions sent immediately, not queued work. A newer profile
selection is applied after the preceding batch terminates, including failed
batches; timed-out requests must all drain before that follow-up can start.
The same failed selection is not automatically retried.
A stopped or failed session returns `invalidRequest`.
Resolution problems are not part of the response; JDT LS reports them as
`pom.xml` diagnostics.

Maven profile application is a
bounded background task: at most eight project commands are in flight, remaining
projects are queued, and each project reports `running`, `succeeded`, or
`failed` with optional error details. Project results use a redacted stable
`projectUri` identifier; they never expose the user's absolute workspace path.
The runtime event also carries the aggregate Maven task status (`running`,
`succeeded`, `partiallySucceeded`, `failed`, `timedOut`, or `cancelled`) so hosts
do not need to infer task completion from log text. A project failure or task timeout does not
terminate an otherwise usable JDT LS session; the host receives a partial-failure
event and may retry. The session reaches `ready` after JDT LS `ServiceReady`.
Core only accepts retries for a ready Java session. A timeout sends `$/cancelRequest`
but retains each in-flight slot until its terminal response arrives. Retry is
rejected while the previous batch is still stopping; if JDT LS never responds,
the user must restart the Java session. Late responses release those slots
without changing the timed-out results.
Hosts reset project results on the structured `mavenProfileTask: "running"`
event and consume `mavenProfileProject` updates directly, scoped to the current
session. Java import completion and Maven task completion use separate UI
notifications so service readiness cannot overwrite a Maven failure.
The session continues to expose profile progress independently. `initializeTimeoutMilliseconds`
only bounds the standard LSP handshake. For a provider such as JDT LS that has
a later readiness signal,
the profile task records a deterministic digest of Maven settings, selected
profiles, project URIs, and source paths; an unchanged successful digest skips
reapplying the same settings, while an explicit retry invalidates that digest.
Hosts may consume lifecycle events for the shared `serverConnected`,
`projectImporting`, `profileApplying`, and `fullyReady` phases.
`serviceReadyIdleTimeoutMilliseconds` retains its wire name but now sets the
quiet-progress **warning** threshold (45 seconds by default). A quiet interval
emits one warning with the last progress snapshot; changed progress rearms the
warning, while duplicate progress does not. JDT progress is not a heartbeat:
silence must not fail the session or terminate its process.
`serviceReadyAbsoluteTimeoutMilliseconds` remains the sole post-initialize
readiness deadline (10 minutes by default), regardless of progress activity. `jdtlsLaunchResources`, when present,
contains `launcherJarPath`, `configurationDirectory`, `lombokAgentPath`, the
legacy optional `javaDebugBundlePath`, and ordered
`javaExtensionBundlePaths`. It is valid only for the Java provider and requires
`runtimeExecutablePath`. Rust loads the legacy Debug bundle first when present,
then appends the extension bundle paths with stable de-duplication. Rust
then uses `runtimeExecutablePath` as the process executable and constructs the
complete deterministic JDT LS JVM argument list. `configurationDirectory` names
the packaged, read-only configuration; Rust never passes it to Equinox, which
writes framework state into its `-configuration` directory. Rust copies the
directory's `config.ini` into
`cacheDirectory/jdtls-configuration/<config.ini SHA-256>/configuration`,
rewrites a missing or damaged copy, and passes that directory instead. A
`cacheDirectory` that resolves inside the JDT LS installation, including
through a symbolic link, fails with `invalid_request` before anything is written;
a missing `config.ini` fails with `process_start_failed`. Areas of other digests
unused for the JDT cache retention period are removed after the area is
prepared, and a removal failure is logged without failing the start. When the structured object is
absent, the selected `executablePath` and legacy wrapper arguments remain the
compatibility path. Rust owns the returned
session's child process, stdin/stdout/stderr, framing buffer, JSON-RPC request
IDs, document versions, pending deadlines, capabilities, diagnostics, and
graceful/forced termination.

JDT LS remains `initializing` until `language/status: ServiceReady`. During this
phase Rust reduces changed `$/progress` notifications into throttled JSON log
details containing the current phase, percentage, project, observed project
count, artifact name, repository host, downloaded/total bytes, calculated
throughput, elapsed/idle durations, and cache disposition. Progress parsing is
observability-only and never substitutes for `ServiceReady`. Absolute readiness failures use `serviceReadyTimeout` at stage `serviceReady`
and retain the final diagnostic snapshot in `underlyingMessage` with
`timeoutKind: "absolute"`. Classification still describes observed silence or
transfer activity; it does not prove a JVM deadlock. Quiet warnings preserve the
initializing/preparation state. Explicit server errors and exits still fail
immediately. Shared timing examples live in
`shared/fixtures/lsp/jdt-readiness-v1.json`.

Platform adapters own filesystem discovery and validate that packaged JDT LS
contains the Equinox launcher, platform configuration directory, Lombok agent,
Java Debug Server, and bundled Java. Java Test-capable hosts additionally
validate their extension bundles and runner. They do not construct JVM commands.
Packaged macOS and Windows plans always use structured direct launch, so runtime
startup has no shell, PowerShell, or user-`PATH` dependency. Wrapper launch
remains optional only for external or older plans.

For JDT LS, platform adapters observe root Maven/Gradle descriptor timestamps
and sizes, names of direct Maven module directories, and the selected JDT LS
version. They submit those raw observations to `java.jdtWorkspaceFingerprint`;
Rust Core validates, sorts, de-duplicates, and constructs the sole portable
fingerprint representation. Core then hashes the normalized workspace identity
followed by a null separator and that opaque fingerprint to select
`cacheDirectory/jdtls/<workspaceKey>`.
Omitting the fingerprint preserves the legacy path-only key for older clients.
Changing structure selects a new directory without deleting the old one, so a
later switch back can reuse it.

Core starts JDT LS with
`-Djava.import.generatesMetadataFilesAtProjectRoot=false`, so the Eclipse
project files JDT LS maintains (`.project`, `.classpath`, `.factorypath`, and
`.settings/*.prefs`) live in that state directory instead of the user's
modules. Before launch, Core removes such files that earlier versions left in a
Maven or Gradle module directory when the enclosing Git repository does not
track them; tracked files and workspaces outside Git are left alone because JDT
LS keeps honoring files that already exist at a module root. Tracking is decided
by the repository that owns each module, located through its `.git` entry, with
one batched `git ls-files` query per repository; modules outside Git start no Git
process. When any file is removed, Core also deletes the current state directory
so the launch imports the modules afresh instead of reusing a model that points
at the removed files, and records the removed workspace-relative paths in the
session's `info` log event.

`java.jdtWorkspaceFingerprint` accepts
`{ buildFiles, directMavenModules, jdtlsVersion }`. Each build-file observation
contains a workspace-relative `path`, `modifiedUnixMilliseconds`, and
`sizeBytes`. It returns `{ workspaceFingerprint }`; platforms must not recreate
or parse this opaque string. Compatibility cases are in
`shared/fixtures/lsp/jdt-workspace-fingerprint-v1.json`.

`lsp.jdtWorkspaceKey` accepts `{ workspaceRoot, workspaceFingerprint? }` and
returns `{ workspaceKey }` through the same normalization and SHA-256 algorithm
used by `lsp.startServer`. Platform cache-maintenance actions use it to remove
only the current workspace/fingerprint directory; they do not clear sibling
workspaces or older structural states.

`java.runMarkers` accepts `{ mainMethods, testItems, testCases }`: the
`methods` of one file's `javaMainMethods` answer, the `items` of its
`javaTestItems` answer (empty when the platform cannot run tests for the file),
and recorded `maven.testResults` `testCases`. It returns `{ markers }` ordered by
zero-based `line`, then `kind` (`main`, `testClass`, `testMethod`). `endLine`
is the last line of the declaration as reported upstream: the end of the body for
test classes and methods, and the name line for `main`. Each marker
has a `label` for menus (`App.main()`, `OrderTest`, `OrderTest.creates`), the
launch target (`mainClass`/`projectName`, or `testClass`/`testMethod` and the
Java Test `testItemId`), and `status`: `none`, `passed`, `failed` (failure or
error), or `skipped`. Test cases match a method by class and method name, with
nested-class `$` and `.` treated alike. A class is `failed` when any recorded
method under it (including nested classes) failed and `passed` when at least
one passed and none failed. Items without a source range, such as inherited
test methods, get no marker. The command is pure and never reads the file
system. `shared/fixtures/java/run-markers-v1.json` is the compatibility fixture.

`java.workspacePolicy` accepts `workspacePaths` and `changedPaths` as
workspace-relative paths. It starts Java tooling when a non-ignored `.java`
source exists and the workspace shows evidence of being a Java project: a build
descriptor (`pom.xml`, `build.gradle[.kts]`, `settings.gradle[.kts]`, a Maven or
Gradle wrapper) no more than two directories below the root, or a `.java` source
no more than two directories below the root for projects that have no build
system. A Java sample or fixture checked into a repository of another ecosystem
therefore does not activate Java tooling; hosts still start a language server on
demand when the user opens a `.java` file. The command chooses one deterministic
representative source and classifies changes as `ignored`, `source`,
`buildConfiguration`, or `other`. The compatibility examples are in
`shared/fixtures/lsp/java-workspace-policy-v1.json`.

`java.jdtCacheRetention` accepts platform-observed cache directory metadata as
`{ nowUnixSeconds, activeWorkspaceKey?, entries }`. Each entry contains a
lowercase 64-character SHA-256 `workspaceKey` and
`lastModifiedUnixSeconds`. Core ignores invalid candidate names, de-duplicates
observations using the newest timestamp, never selects the active key, and
returns deterministically sorted `expiredWorkspaceKeys` older than the fixed
30-day retention period. Platform adapters own the last-used marker, directory
enumeration, revalidation, deletion, and error logging; Core performs no cache
filesystem I/O. See `shared/fixtures/lsp/jdt-cache-retention-v1.json`.

`lsp.syncDocument` accepts `{ sessionId, uri, languageId, text?, contentChanges? }`.
The first sync emits `didOpen` at version 1. Later syncs emit `didChange` with
increasing versions. When the server advertised incremental `textDocumentSync`
and `contentChanges` includes LSP ranges, the notification carries those
range-based edits and does not require a full document `text` field. Otherwise
the change is a full-text replacement. The response is
`{ documentVersion, changed }`; submitting identical full text returns
`changed: false`, preserves the version, and emits no LSP notification.

`lsp.workspaceFilesChanged` accepts a session ID and ordered file URI changes
whose `kind` is `created`, `changed`, or `deleted`. It emits one
`workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` notification. Open documents remain owned by
versioned `lsp.syncDocument`; adapters must not duplicate those edits as watcher
events.

`java.navigationMarkers` accepts
`{ sessionId, operationId?, uri, documentVersion? }` and completes with
`{ documentVersion, markers }`. Rust combines JDT LS implementation CodeLens,
`textDocument/implementation`, and `java/findLinks` results with parser-selected
Java declaration candidates. Work is capped at 64 semantic tasks, individual
task failures preserve other verified markers, stale document versions cancel
the batch, and the latest completed version is cached per URI. Markers are
sorted by line, UTF-16 column, and relation. A marker contains `direction`
(`up` or `down`) and `relation` (`interface` or `inheritance`); zero-target
declarations are omitted. The cross-platform examples are in
`shared/fixtures/lsp/java-navigation-v1.json`.

`java.resolveNavigation` accepts the marker position, direction, relation, and
document version. Downward markers use `textDocument/implementation`; upward
markers use JDT LS `java/findLinks` with `superImplementation`. Its terminal
result is `{ documentVersion, locations }`, using the same normalized physical
and virtual-location representation as ordinary navigation.

`lsp.request` accepts a semantic `operation` plus
the operation-specific URI, position, range, diagnostics, item, action, or
command fields, and returns `{ operationId }`. Supported operations include
completion and resolve, hover, definition/declaration/type-definition, references,
implementation, rename, formatting, code actions and resolve, execute command,
inlay hints, full-document semantic tokens, folding ranges, code lens, provider
virtual documents, `javaEntrypoints`, `javaTestItems`, and `javaMainMethods`.
`javaEntrypoints` invokes Java Debug Server's
`vscode.java.resolveMainClass` for the session workspace and returns schema
version 1 with deterministic workspace-relative `{ sourcePath, mainClass,
projectName? }` entries plus diagnostics for unusable upstream records.
`javaTestItems` requires a file URI, invokes Java Test's
`vscode.java.test.findTestTypesAndMethods`, and returns schema version 1 with a
typed class/method tree. Each item carries the upstream identity, label, fully
qualified name, project, test kind/level, optional JDT handler and sort text,
optional zero-based UTF-16 range, and children. A `null` upstream result means
the file has no tests (Java Test leaves its root's children unset) and yields an
empty item list; any other non-list top-level result is an
`invalidServerResult`, never an empty semantic answer.
`javaMainMethods` requires a file URI, invokes Java Debug Server's
`vscode.java.resolveMainMethod`, and returns schema version 1 with
`{ methods: [{ range, mainClass, projectName? }], diagnostics }`. `range` is the
zero-based UTF-16 range of the method name, and methods are ordered by source
position. `mainClass` matches the `javaEntrypoints` entry generated for the same
file, so editors can launch the workspace configuration for that entry. A `null`
upstream result means no launchable method; any other non-list result is an
`invalidServerResult`. Core does not infer Java entry points or tests from
source syntax.
For the Java provider, an `executeCommand` whose command is
`vscode.java.buildWorkspace` is coordinated by Core instead of being written
immediately. Core writes it only when no earlier build is awaiting its JDT
response, the Maven profile task is not `running`, and no JDT work-done
progress job named `Update project …`, `Updating project configurations`,
`Applying the selected build files…`, or `Updating workspace folders` is open;
a job without progress for 120 seconds stops blocking. Identical queued build
commands share one JDT request, while a running build is never shared. Each
caller is bounded by `javaBuildTimeoutMilliseconds` from `lsp.startServer`
(default 600000), measured from submission; its `requestTimeout` error has stage
`javaBuild` and an `underlyingMessage` naming the reached phase
(`building`, `waitingForPreviousBuild`, `waitingForMavenProfiles`, or
`waitingForProjectConfiguration`). Cancellation or timeout sends
`$/cancelRequest` only when no running or queued caller still needs a build,
and the build keeps its slot until JDT answers. A successful build completes
with the unchanged `{ value: 1 }` result. Other JDT `BuildWorkspaceStatus`
values complete with stage `javaBuild` and code `javaBuildCompilationErrors`
(`WITH_ERROR`), `javaBuildFailed` (`FAILED`), `javaBuildCancelled`
(`CANCELLED`), or `invalidServerResult`. `javaBuildCompilationErrors` and
`javaBuildFailed` additionally carry `javaBuildReport` with `markerScope`
(`launchTarget` or `workspace`), `builderFailedEarlier`,
`elapsedMilliseconds`, and `recovery` (`none` or `rebuildJavaIndex`). The marker
scope is inferred from the dispatched command: `launchTarget` means the request
named a project, not that Core observed Java Debug Server's final project
selection. Elapsed time is evidence only and must not become a heuristic gate.
The versioned examples are in
`shared/fixtures/lsp/java-build-report-v1.json`.

Hosts treat these two terminal build outcomes as evidence rather than an
irrevocable launch veto. After resolving the usable runtime paths, they may let
the user continue that same launch attempt without issuing another build. A
cancelled, timed-out, rejected, or unrecognized build has no usable verdict and
must be retried instead of overridden. Hosts present Core's message and report
instead of inferring a cause. Core logs `Java project build is waiting` (with `reason`),
`Java project build started`, and `Java project build finished` (with
`outcome`, `errorCode`, `elapsedMilliseconds`, and `waiterCount`).
Background build retries and deadline cancellations are written by a separate
session-owned worker. The deadline monitor never writes to stdin. A background
write that exceeds `requestTimeoutMilliseconds` fails the session with
`transportFailed` at stage `outboundMaintenance` and terminates the server to
release the stalled pipe; the Java build deadline still bounds queue and build time.
The `semanticTokens` operation uses the open document URI and normal version,
timeout, and cancellation rules. Its result is
`{ tokenTypes, tokenModifiers, tokens: [{ line, startChar, length, tokenType, tokenModifiers }] }`.
Token positions use zero-based LSP lines and UTF-16 columns; `tokenType` indexes
the returned legend and `tokenModifiers` is a UInt32 bitset. Core decodes the
server's relative positions with the legend captured when the request was sent.
Range-only providers are not advertised as supporting this operation. No delta
result ID crosses the boundary. See `shared/fixtures/lsp/semantic-tokens-v1.json`.
The `semanticTokensRefresh` event invalidates the host's semantic color cache
when the server requests `workspace/semanticTokens/refresh`; the request receives
a JSON-RPC null acknowledgment. Windows maps `lsp_get_semantic_tokens` to this
existing operation and forwards refresh events as `lsp://semantic-tokens-refresh`
with `{ sessionId, workspacePath }`; only the owning frontend session invalidates
its Monaco provider. The shared payload and legend remain unchanged.
The `virtualDocument` operation accepts `{ sessionId, operation,
virtualUri }` without a document `uri`. Its terminal `requestCompleted` event
returns `{ text }`, where `text` is the provider-resolved UTF-8 source for the
opaque virtual URI.

`lsp.pollEvents` drains events ordered by per-session `sequence`. `lsp.waitEvents`
accepts `{ sessionId, timeoutMilliseconds }` and waits on a session event
channel until events are queued or the timeout elapses, then drains the same
typed events. Hosts should use `waitEvents` so idle sessions do not poll.
Event types
include `stateChanged`, `featuresChanged`, `diagnostics`,
`requestCompleted`, `serverInfoChanged`, and `log`. Every request completes at
most once with either `result` or a structured runtime error containing
provider/session, stage, optional method/document/request, stable code, and
optional process-exit detail. Late responses after cancellation or deadline
are ignored. Diagnostics are accepted only for documents open in the current
session, and versioned diagnostics must match the current document version.

The client reducer, raw JSON-RPC message, frame, and parser functions are
internal Rust implementation seams; they are not public application commands.
Completion, hover, navigation, edit, hint, folding, and code-lens responses are
normalized by Rust before they cross the application boundary. Unknown server
requests receive JSON-RPC `Method not found` instead of being silently ignored.

The `history.*` commands accept an adapter-selected `storageRoot`; history
metadata never stores an absolute workspace or storage path. `history.record`
accepts `workspaceRoot`, a relative `path`, a `reason`, and optional UTF-8
`content`; when content is omitted the core reads the workspace file. Records
are versioned, de-duplicated against the latest snapshot, capped at 100 entries
per file, and pruned after 30 days. Invalid metadata and missing snapshot files
are ignored. `history.entries` returns Unix-second timestamps and relative
`contentPath` values. `history.content` rejects traversal,
`history.relocate` updates metadata and storage paths, and `history.rename` and
`history.delete` validate both the relative file path and entry ID before
changing stored metadata.

`maven.scan` accepts `{ "root": string, "paths"?: string[] }` and returns
`null` when neither the root nor the supplied visible workspace-relative paths
contain a readable `pom.xml`. Candidates are tried in shallowest-first order,
with `/`-normalized lexical paths breaking ties, until one parses successfully;
a malformed candidate does not hide a valid nested project. A project response
contains its workspace `relativePath`,
`groupId`, `artifactId`, `version`, `packaging`, recursive `modules`, `profiles`,
and `hasWrapper`. The root project and every recursive module also contain a
`sourceRoots` list. Each entry has a module-relative `/`-normalized `path` and
a `kind` of `mainJava`, `mainResources`, `testJava`, `testResources`,
`generatedMain`, or `generatedTest`. Standard Maven roots are returned before
their directories exist; explicit `<build>` source/resource directories and
`maven-compiler-plugin` generated-source directories or
`build-helper-maven-plugin` source lists replace the corresponding defaults,
whether configured directly on the plugin or within an execution.
`${project.build.directory}` resolves from `<build><directory>` and defaults to
`target` only when that element is absent; unresolved or invalid explicit
values do not silently fall back.
Absolute, unresolved-property, and parent-traversal paths are omitted so one
module cannot claim another module's source root. Entries are de-duplicated and
ordered by the documented kind order, then path. Aggregator-only `pom` modules
have no default roots. Module paths are relative to the selected Maven root and
use `/` separators. Malformed XML returns `parse_failed`. Source-root examples
are in `shared/fixtures/maven/source-roots-v1.json`.

`maven.launchPlan` accepts a workspace `root`, a versioned `context`, an
optional reactor-relative `module`, and an ordered `goals` array whose first
entry is a lifecycle or custom goal. Later entries may be ordinary Maven CLI
arguments such as `-Dname=value` or `-q`. They remain separate process arguments
and are never interpreted by a shell. Context version 1 contains the
workspace-relative `reactorPath`,
selected `profiles`, optional platform-local `settingsPath` and
`localRepositoryPath`, `skipTests`, and optional Maven/JDK paths used only for
the configuration fingerprint. The response contains the `project-maven`
toolchain reference, an argument array, the workspace-relative reactor working
directory, and a deterministic SHA-256 configuration fingerprint. Profiles are
sorted and de-duplicated. Module plans from `maven.launchPlan` and Maven-backed
Run and Debug plans use `-pl <module> -am`. Settings use `-s`; a local
repository override uses `-Dmaven.repo.local=<path>`; skipped tests use
`-DskipTests`. Explicit Run `cwd`, Profiles, and `extensions.maven.skipTests`
values override the project context, including `skipTests: false`. The core
never reads `settings.xml` and never copies its path into a portable project
document. Maven itself continues to read `.mvn/maven.config`; the plan does not
expand or duplicate that file's arguments. Fixtures are in
`shared/fixtures/maven/launch-plan-v1.json`.

`maven.dependencyPlan` accepts the same workspace `root`, versioned `context`,
optional reactor-relative `module`, and a required absolute `outputFile`. It
returns a launch plan for the fixed `maven-dependency-plugin:3.8.1:tree` goal
that writes the verbose text tree to `outputFile` in UTF-8 with standard tree
tokens, disabled color, and an English locale. Exactly one project runs because
every project in the session would overwrite the same file: module queries use
`-pl <module>` without `-am`, and reactor-root queries use `-N`. The read-only
query does not build reactor dependencies. Platform adapters own the child
process, apply a bounded timeout, and keep it independent from an ordinary Maven
build session. They also own `outputFile`: each invocation receives a fresh
path in a platform scratch directory, and the platform removes it after the
result, cancellation, timeout, or failure. The process's console output is log
text only and is never parsed as dependency data.

`maven.dependencies` accepts `{ "modulePath": string, "outputFile": string }`
after the plan's process exits successfully and returns the normalized module
path plus a recursively nested `dependencies` array. Each node contains
`modulePath`, `groupId`, `artifactId`, `version`, `type`, nullable `classifier`,
`scope`, `resolution`, nullable `selectedVersion`, nullable
`premanagedVersion` and `premanagedScope` (values before dependency
management), nullable `originalScope` (declared scope before mediation widened
it), nullable `ignoredScope` (a wider scope mediation did not apply), and
`children`. Resolution is `resolved`, `omittedDuplicate`, or `omittedConflict`;
`selectedVersion` is the winning version of an omitted conflict. Every level is
sorted deterministically.

The first line of the file must name the module and every later line must be a
node with only the annotations the pinned plugin writes; any other content,
invalid UTF-8, a line over 4 KiB, more than 10,000 nodes, 64 levels, or a file
over the byte limit derived from those bounds returns `parse_failed` instead of
a partial tree. A missing file returns `process_failed`. The compatibility
fixture is `shared/fixtures/maven/dependency-tree-v2.json`.

`maven.diagnostics` accepts `{ "root": string, "output": string }` and returns
`{ "issues": [] }`. Diagnostic paths may be absolute or workspace-relative;
the response preserves the path text, uses one-based line and column values,
and normalizes severity to `error` or `warning`. Duplicate issue lines are
removed deterministically.

`runConfig.selectJava` reads only the existing workspace
`.lithe/toolchains/requirements.json` document. Its request contains optional
`root`, `candidates` (`id`, probed `version`, numeric source `priority`), and
`fallbackId`. IDs are opaque machine-local identities, never persisted or opened
by this operation. Lower priority wins; equal-priority candidates use descending
numeric Java versions (including legacy `1.8`), then ascending ID.

When `project-jdk.minimumVersion` exists, selection first filters using the same
Java version comparison as run-configuration diagnostics. The response is
`{ id, warning }`: the compatible candidate, or the supplied usable fallback
with an actionable warning if none qualifies. Missing requirements retain the
platform's unconstrained choice; malformed/unsupported documents return the
existing parse/version error. Explicit configured paths bypass automatic
selection. The operation never generates requirements or probes executables.
The cross-platform examples are in
`shared/fixtures/run-configuration/automatic-java-selection.json`.

Windows `run_resolve_toolchains` includes an optional `warning` on resolved
JDKs, including inherited Maven JDKs. This warning remains visible even when no
run configuration exists to carry a scoped `toolchainVersionMismatch` diagnostic.

`runConfig.inspect` also returns the local document-level `toolchain`, including
when no generated configuration exists (`status: "missing"`). Settings,
toolchain-only callers, and initial run-panel presentation may send
`checkFingerprint: false` to validate documents without traversing or hashing
project sources. Omission preserves full inspection. The Windows run panel
publishes readable configurations first, then performs full inspection and
reports freshness failures without discarding those configurations.
The input fingerprint covers what generation reads: build and tool files and
the sources of generated Java entries by content (`sha256:<hex>` in
`generator.inputs`), and every other Java source by path only (`path`), so
editing a class body is not a staleness. When the stored inputs no longer
reproduce the stored fingerprint, the document came from another generator
revision and the diagnostic says so instead of listing modified files.
`runConfig.inspect` also accepts optional schema-versioned `javaEntrypoints`
from the current `lsp.request` result, independent of `checkFingerprint`. Core
then compares JDT's `(sourcePath, mainClass)` pairs, with a `module/` prefix
removed and nested checkouts excluded, against the generated Java entries and
reports a difference as a `staleFingerprint` diagnostic. Platforms send it
after a project load once the Java service has prepared the project, never
start that service for this check, and skip it while a regeneration already
waits for the service.
Project environment saves use the existing local `runConfig.updateOptions`
toolchain payload with an empty `configurationId`; service overrides are untouched.

The `runConfig.*` commands implement the versioned project protocol described
by the JSON Schemas in this directory. `runConfig.inspect` accepts `root` and
never writes files. `runConfig.generate` accepts `root`, relative Java `paths`,
relative `modulePaths`, and optional schema-versioned `javaEntrypoints` from the
current `lsp.request` result. When Java tooling is still preparing, omission
retains the previous generated entrypoint facts instead of running a local
scanner or replacing them with an empty list. It returns generated configuration
and toolchain requirement documents for the platform adapter to write atomically. Maven root
discovery checks `pom.xml` along each supplied path's ancestor chain, so a
reactor nested below the opened workspace does not depend on the platform
including build descriptors in `paths`. Maven ownership is resolved per Java
entry: standalone sources keep the JDK launch path, while entries from
independent nested reactors retain their own reactor working directory and
module selector. Generated fingerprints include both project inputs and the
detector revision; either changing marks persisted output stale and requires
regeneration.

`runConfig.resolve` accepts `root`, optional local `toolchainCandidates`, and
optional `localDocument`. When `localDocument` is present, Core uses that JSON
object as the local layer instead of reading `.lithe/run/local.json`. It merges
configurations by stable ID using this precedence:
`local.json > configurations.json > generated.json`. Scalars and arrays are
replaced by the higher layer, while toolchain maps merge by key. It returns
effective configurations, their source, the team default, structured
diagnostics for stale, orphaned, missing, disabled, and toolchain mismatch
states, the effective global `toolchain`, and the machine-local
`localToolchains` document. Toolchain diagnostics carry the affected run
configuration ID when a requirement is consumed by one or more configurations;
requirements with no configuration consumer do not emit a blocking diagnostic.
For detected Maven configurations, resolved `extensions.maven.reactorPath`
contains the workspace-relative reactor from the generated layer, independently
of an overridden effective `cwd`. Core derives this read-only ownership value
when resolving existing generated documents as well; regeneration is not
required. Overrides cannot move a configuration to another reactor. Current
File and configurations without detected Maven ownership omit this field.
Resolution checks that `extensions.maven.module` exists relative to this
reactor, or relative to `root` when the field is absent, and never relative to
an overridden `cwd`: setting a module's own directory as the working directory
keeps the configuration available.
Module menus first match reactor and module, then apply the default preference;
they must not infer ownership from an overridden working directory. The shared
`run-configuration/maven-module-ownership.json` fixture covers independent
reactors, cwd overrides, and the ordinary Java main / Current File capabilities.

Each configuration carries a `category` of `project` or `infrastructure`.
Docker Compose detections are `infrastructure`: a Compose file in an application
repository declares the databases and brokers the project runs against, not the
project itself. The field is omitted for `project`, which is the default, so
existing generated documents keep their exact shape. Hosts present
infrastructure apart from the project's own services and must not include it in
"run all services" or in the default service selection.

Windows implements this grouping. During the macOS transition, Compose entries
remain in its execution-based Services scope; category-based grouping and service
selection filtering are pending there.

Display names that repeat are qualified by Core, because hosts show the name
alone: the first candidate that separates every entry in the group wins, trying
the Maven module, then the working directory, then the source manifest. Three
Compose files each declaring `compose up` become `compose up (script/docker)`
and so on, while a name that occurs once is never decorated. Ids are unaffected.

Java entry points are read from the Java syntax tree rather than matched as
text, so a `static void main` or `@SpringBootApplication` inside a string
literal or comment — common in test fixtures and documentation samples — does
not become a run configuration. A declared `main` under `src/test` remains a
valid entry and keeps the test classpath; see
`shared/fixtures/execution/maven-java-main-source-sets-v1.json`.

A process detector declares a runtime binding only when that command genuinely
consumes the runtime. npm, pnpm, and Yarn scripts consume `project-node`; Bun
scripts keep their independent `bun` command and do not acquire a Node
requirement. Go, Python, Cargo, and Gradle remain command-based until every host
provides the corresponding configurable runtime registry, so their PATH-based
launch behavior is not blocked by an unavailable platform selector.
During resolution, Core also reconciles npm, pnpm, and Yarn commands from older
v2 generated documents with the same `project-node` binding. This compatibility
normalization is based on the effective command, does not mutate the stored
document, and keeps legacy hybrid projects scoped without requiring regeneration.
A document-level `toolchain`
object in the local layer (e.g.
`{ "java": { "homePath": ... }, "maven": { "executablePath": ..., "javaHomePath": ... } }`)
provides defaults for every configuration's `extensions.java.*`. A non-empty
per-configuration toolchain path overrides the corresponding project default.

`runConfig.updateOptions` and `runConfig.createUserConfiguration` are pure
document transformations. They validate scope, paths, supported types, stable
IDs, main classes, modules, and argument parsing, then return UTF-8 JSON in the
`document` field. The platform adapter selects the target project or local
file and performs the atomic write. These commands never write files. An empty
`workingDirectory` removes the layer's `cwd` override. A non-empty value must
name an existing directory inside `root`, given relative to it or as an
absolute path, and is stored project-relative. Values are literal paths; editor
variables such as `${workspaceFolder}` are rejected rather than stored, because
resolution disables and omits a configuration whose `cwd` does not exist. Optional
`mavenSkipTests` writes `extensions.maven.skipTests`; omission removes the
override so the project Maven context is inherited, while explicit `false`
continues to run tests even when the project default skips them.
For project-scoped option updates, selected toolchain paths must resolve inside
`root` and are persisted with `/`-separated project-relative paths. Local-scoped
updates may carry host absolute paths. `runConfig.updateOptions` and
`runConfig.inspect` accept the same optional `localDocument` override.
When `updateOptions` carries a `toolchain` object (`javaHomePath`,
`mavenExecutablePath`, `mavenJavaHomePath`), it writes the document-level
global toolchain into the local layer instead of patching a configuration;
project scope rejects this payload because toolchain paths are machine-local.

`runConfig.saveEditorChanges` accepts the normal option-edit payload plus the
required `toolchain` object. In addition to Java and Maven paths, that object
may contain `runtimeExecutablePaths`, keyed by stable generic toolchain ID. It
applies the global toolchain and configuration override edits together,
returning `localDocument`, either a `projectDocument` string or `null`, and
either a `toolchainDocument` string or `null`. The latter updates
`.lithe/toolchains/local.json`, preserves unrelated toolchain IDs, and removes
an entry when its supplied executable path is empty. Local scope combines the
run-option edits in the local run document. Project scope returns the local
defaults and team options as separate fully prepared documents; the platform
adapter writes all returned documents as one transaction with rollback. Empty
per-configuration toolchain paths remove the
corresponding override keys while preserving unrelated extension fields.
Platform clients report the editor save as successful only after the written
documents resolve again. Failures identify whether preparation, document
writing, or post-save reload failed; a reload failure keeps the last usable UI
snapshot and states that the documents were already saved.

Automatic runtime discovery produces an effective executable path for the
current session. Platforms use that same path both to construct
`toolchainCandidates` and to resolve the launch command. An automatic path is
not a persisted user selection and is written to `.lithe/toolchains/local.json`
only after an explicit editor save.
On Windows, Node-backed commands resolve their package-manager shim from the
selected Node installation. They do not fall back to a PATH shim from another
installation, and Windows executable extensions take precedence over extensionless
shell scripts.

`runConfig.createLaunchPlan` accepts `root`, `configurationId`, optional
`currentFile` and `classPath`, optional `debugPort`, and optional
`localDocument`. Maven-backed Run and Debug callers may also supply the same
versioned `mavenContext` accepted by `maven.launchPlan`. Explicit profiles in
the resolved Run Configuration replace the context profiles; otherwise the
project profiles are inherited. Explicit `extensions.maven.skipTests` and
`cwd` values also replace the context values. Core applies the shared settings,
module, Skip Tests, and reactor-working-directory rules to the generated
framework arguments, including `-am` for selected reactor modules. A
project-owned `java.main` caller, or a `spring-boot.maven` caller whose generated
configuration records a Java entry source, instead supplies `javaLaunch` with
the exact JDT LS-selected `mainClass` plus structured `classPaths` and
`modulePaths`. Core then produces a direct `project-jdk` launch; it never
projects those Java entry points into a reactor-wide Maven launch goal. A Spring
Boot configuration without a resolved Java entry source retains its Maven-goal
compatibility path. It
returns a toolchain
reference, argument array, project-relative working directory, and structured
environment references. It does not return a shell command or platform
executable path. All project paths use `/`, reject absolute paths and `..`
traversal, and remain relative to `root`.

The plan may also carry three optional envelope fields. `preLaunchSteps` is an
ordered array of `{ executable, arguments, classpath? }` steps the host runs to
completion, in order, before the main process; a non-zero exit aborts the run
and surfaces that step's diagnostics. Each step's `executable` reuses the plan's
`{ toolchain }` shape plus an optional `tool` selector (`"javac"` resolves the
sibling compiler in the toolchain's `bin` directory; absent means the default
launcher). `classpath` is a structured array of project-relative or host-absolute
entries the host joins with the platform path separator (`:` on POSIX, `;` on
Windows) and prepends as `["-cp", joined]` to the relevant argument list; core
never joins classpath entries because the separator is platform-specific.
`modulepath` follows the same rule and is emitted as `--module-path` by the
host. A JDT main identity in `module/name.Type` form is projected as
`-m module/name.Type` for the direct Java launcher. Empty fields are omitted,
so existing single-process Maven, Gradle, and Node
plans are unchanged. Pre-launch steps and the main process share the plan-level
`workingDirectory` and `environment`.

A Maven-project `java.main` launch must first ask JDT LS/Java Debug
Server to resolve the exact source target, build its owning project, and return
the runtime classpath/module path. Missing project launch metadata is a launch
error rather than permission to fall back to `mvn exec:java`; reactor-wide Exec
would attempt the same main class in parent and dependency modules.

A `java.main` configuration without a
Maven toolchain launches through `project-jdk` and the configuration's Java
source path only when that source has no Maven ancestor. An older configuration
that omitted the Maven binding is rejected with an instruction to regenerate.
Standalone Java (`java.main` without Maven, and `java.current-file`) compiles
before running: core emits a `javac` pre-launch step writing `.class` files to
`.lithe/run/classes/<configurationId>`, puts that directory on the run
`classpath`, and launches by the qualified class name rather than the source
file. This keeps one-click Run working on JDK 8, which lacks the JEP 330
single-file source launcher (`java File.java`) that only exists on JDK 11+. The
`java.current-file` main class is derived from the file's `package` and declared
class; when the host supplies a project `classPath`, the compiled output leads
the run classpath and the project classes feed the compile step.

`java.codeVision` accepts a workspace root, a target Java path, and Java source
paths. It returns declaration locations and usage counts; Git blame attribution
is joined by the UI from the shared Git result. `java.className` accepts Java
source text and a file simple name and returns the fully qualified runtime class
name.

`java.sourceDefinition` accepts `source`, `declarationName`, and an optional
`memberName`, returning zero-based `line` and UTF-16 `utf16Column` or `null`
when no declaration is found.

`java.structure` accepts Java `source` and optional `declarationSources`. It
returns `foldRegions`, `inlayHints`, and `syntaxHighlights`.
Fold and inlay line numbers are zero-based because these values are editor
offsets; UTF-16 columns and hidden ranges match the native text editor coordinate
system. Syntax highlights contain document-relative `utf16Start`,
`utf16Length`, and a role from the shared editor syntax-theme contract. They
are sorted and non-overlapping, so native renderers can apply semantic colors
without maintaining another Java parser. The parser is platform-independent
and does not start a Java process or contact JDT.

`spring.index` accepts `root`, workspace-relative `paths`, optional trusted
absolute `metadataRepositories` (and the legacy singular `metadataRepository`),
optional `textOverrides` keyed by relative path, and
`refreshDependencyMetadata`. The command reads Spring configuration
metadata from workspace JSON files and dependency JARs, indexes application
configuration documents and Java source, and returns deterministically ordered
`properties`, `values`, `propertyReferences`, `diagnostics`, `beans`,
`injections`, and `endpoints` collections. Locations use relative paths and
one-based lines and columns.

`properties` include type, documentation, default value, and an optional Java
declaration. `values` include profile/override state and an optional declaration
target. `propertyReferences` represent Java `@Value` uses. Bean resolution
accounts for component names, `@Bean` aliases, interfaces, `@Qualifier`,
`@Resource`, `@Primary`, field injection, and constructor injection. Endpoint
entries expand multiple controller/method paths and retain the exact declared
HTTP method set.

Dependency metadata is cached in the Rust process. Project-open indexing sets
`refreshDependencyMetadata` to `true`; debounced unsaved-buffer indexing leaves
it `false`, so editing Java or configuration files does not repeatedly traverse
and open the local dependency repository. The repository path is selected by
the platform composition layer and is never persisted in shared results.

`mybatis.index` accepts `root`, workspace-relative `paths`, and optional
`textOverrides` keyed by relative path. It pairs Java mapper types with XML
`<mapper namespace>` documents and returns only statements that have both a
Java method and a matching XML `select`/`insert`/`update`/`delete` `id`.
Results are deterministically ordered by namespace, statement id, XML path,
and line. Locations use relative paths and one-based lines and columns.
`javaLine`/`javaColumn` point at the method name; `javaEndColumn` is the
exclusive UTF-16 column after that name. `javaEndLine` is the signature
terminator. `xmlLine`/`xmlColumn`/`xmlEndColumn` bound the statement `id`
value the same way. Hosts intercept go-to-definition only when the caret
is inside those name ranges; return types and parameters keep LSP
navigation. Java methods are collected from `tree-sitter-java` syntax
nodes, so nested generics, split signatures, and commented-out methods
are not mistaken for declarations. XML comments are ignored. Methods with
a method body, including `default` methods, are omitted from the Java
side of the index. Paths are indexed only when they are regular `.java`
or mapper `.xml` files no larger than 2 MiB; `pom.xml` and other
extensions are skipped before content is read.

`diagnostics.redactText` accepts `text` and returns `redacted` with
credentials, tokens, and home-directory paths replaced by stable placeholders
(`<redacted>` for secrets, `<HOME>` for a macOS/Linux `Users`/`home` path or a
Windows drive-letter `Users` path). Hosts run every diagnostic-bundle log
line, panic report, and other free-form text through this command before it
is staged for export; the command never reads the filesystem itself.
Re-running it over already-redacted text is a no-op.

`diagnostics.buildManifest` accepts an `environment` object
(`appVersion`, `osName`, `osVersion`, `cpuCoreCount`, `memoryRssBytes`,
`diskFreeBytes`), a `files` array of already-staged, already-redacted entries
(`relativePath`, `sizeBytes`, `description`), and
`generatedAtEpochMilliseconds`. It returns a `schemaVersion`ed manifest with
`files` sorted by `relativePath` so the listing shown to the user before they
confirm a diagnostic export — and the zip's contents — are deterministic
across runs and across platforms. Hosts gather the environment and file facts
natively; this command only shapes and sorts them.

### Git patch discovery and rebase amendment preconditions

`git.patchExport` accepts optional `metadataOnly` (default false). In metadata
mode it returns candidate file counts and rename identities with empty `patch`
and zero `byteLength`, independently of patch text encoding and exchange size.
See [Patch exchange](git-patch-exchange.md) and its metadata fixture.

`git.rebaseControl` requires `expectedHead` when `amendMessage` is present.
Missing or stale HEAD rejects the amendment before writing; plain Continue,
Skip and Abort do not require this field. Both products must send the HEAD
reviewed by the amendment editor. See [Rebase sessions](git-rebase-session.md).

Completion items returned by the LSP client and runtime preserve `insertTextFormat`
(`1` for plain text, `2` for snippets; absent values default to `1`). Hosts retain
this field through completion resolution. Monaco applies snippet text with its
snippet insertion rule so placeholders participate in selection and undo rather

than being inserted as literal source text. The initialize handshake advertises
`completion.completionItem.labelDetailsSupport` and resolve support for
`labelDetails` so language servers attach typed class/namespace labels on
incomplete items. Core forwards `labelDetails` and omits null `data` so
`completionItem/resolve` can still produce import `use`/`import` edits.

### Java preparation snapshot

Java `projectPreparation` runtime events carry a `result` object with `phase`
(`starting`, `importing`, `configuring`, `building`, `ready`, `stopped`), `status`
(`idle`, `loading`, `ready`, `failed`) and boolean `blocksRun`.
`lsp.pollEvents` and `lsp.waitEvents` also return `projectPreparation` (the current
snapshot or null) alongside `events`, so restored consumers need not replay the
queue. Event session identity and sequence retain their existing semantics.

The snapshot reuses the existing service-ready signal, profile-task results and
configuration/build coordinator. Generic indexing never blocks Run. Profile
failure is visible but does not globally block unrelated targets; callers still
build the selected target before launching. A successful preparation does not
promise compilation success. Shared examples live in
`shared/fixtures/lsp/project-preparation-v1.json`.

### Workspace commit preconditions

`git.commitState` accepts `{ root }` and returns `{ head, branch, indexEntries,
gitlinks, stagedPaths, conflictedPaths }`. `head` is null only for an unborn branch; `branch` is
null for detached HEAD. `indexEntries` is Git's opaque NUL-delimited staged index
listing, including blob IDs and conflict stages; clients compare it without
parsing it. `gitlinks` lists stage-0 mode-160000 entries as `{ path, revision }`.
`stagedPaths` disables rename detection so both deleted and added paths are listed;
local selection guards must not miss the old side of a rename.
Read failures are errors, never an empty relationship list.
The requested root must still be Git's exact working-tree root. Removing a
nested repository's metadata must fail instead of falling back to its parent;
gitlink updates also verify the child boundary before reading its HEAD.

`git.write` / `commit` optionally accepts `expectedCommitState` and
`gitlinkUpdates: [{ path, revision }]`. Gitlink updates cannot accompany other
operations or path-selected commits. Push also accepts `expectedCommitState`
to reject a changed repository under its writer lease. Workspace pushes set
`checkSubmodules: true`, invoking Git's `--recurse-submodules=check` so missing child
commits block a parent push even when only the parent pointer was selected. Under the existing repository writer lease,
Core verifies HEAD/index, validates all child HEAD revisions, then updates only
those parent index entries in a single `update-index --index-info` transaction
before the regular commit. Any changed precondition returns `invalid_request`
through the existing operation error envelope. Unrelated unstaged parent files
are not added. A failing hook may leave the pointer staged: clients must retain
partial progress and re-read state before retrying. External Git processes do
not participate in Lithe's lease; cross-repository commits are not atomic.

`git.status.changes[]` additionally carries optional `submodule` with
`commitChanged`, `trackedChanges`, and `untrackedChanges`, normalized from Git
porcelain v2. The existing two-character `status` remains compatible. The optional request flag
`includeIndexOnlyChanges` retains staged additions deleted only from the working
tree (`AD`); both products enable it so every staged file remains visible. Omission
preserves the legacy final-worktree projection. Child dirt
alone is informational in the parent; only a changed commit pointer (or an
already-staged change) is eligible for the parent's staging checkbox.

`git.status` accepts optional `repositoryRoots` (native bindings of discovered
repositories). Untracked paths owned by a nested root are excluded from the
parent list. Each change returns `canToggleStaging`; platforms render that
eligibility instead of reinterpreting submodule dirt.

`git.workspaceCommitPrepare` owns the complete multi-repository policy. It accepts
`repositories: [{ id, root }]`, `message`, `amend`, `push`,
`includeParentReferences`, optional `previous` session for retry, and optional
`reviewed` plan for confirmation. `id` is a workspace-relative path with `/`
separators (`..` is allowed for enclosing repositories). Windows manually selected
roots on another volume use a stable `external/<encoded-volume>/<path>` virtual
workspace ID. `root` is the native
execution binding, never a portable identity. The response is
`{ session, reviewChanged, requiresConfirmation }`. Core reads all repositories,
finds real gitlink relationships, includes clean parents when requested, orders
children first, and adds push-only child work where needed. Cycles fail closed.
A changed reviewed plan must be displayed and confirmed again before any step.

An optional `pathScope: { include, paths: { <repository-id>: [<relative-path>] } }`
restricts local changelist commits. With `include: true`, only the listed literal
paths are allowed; with `include: false`, the listed paths are excluded. Missing
repository entries mean an empty set, not unrestricted access in inclusion mode.
This is an exact-path guard, not a Git pathspec and not a second staging index.
Core rejects any staged file or automatic parent-reference update outside the
scope before executing mutations. It never silently unstages other lists. Scope
changes invalidate a reviewed plan; retries inherit the original scope and may
not replace it. Continuations retain the scope and validate it before writes,
alongside the existing exact HEAD/index checks. Omitted scopes preserve existing
clients' behavior. Shared examples: `shared/fixtures/git/local-changelist-scope-v1.json`.

`git.workspaceCommitStep` accepts `{ session }` and returns the next session,
executing at most one commit or push. Session fields are `plan`, last observed
`states`, per-ID `results`, `blocked`, `cursor`, `commandFailed`, `finished`,
`succeeded`, and `canRetry`. They are Core-owned continuations: clients return
them unchanged and must not independently choose roots, reorder work, or infer
completion. `plan` includes bindings, options, `orderedIds`, propagation and
dependency relations, reviewed states, `committedIds`, and `pendingPushIds`.
Each result separates `committed`, `pushed`, stable `status`, and Git `detail`.
Status keys are `pending`, `notIncluded`, `waitingForSubmodule`, `reviewRequired`,
`committed`, `committedPushPending`, `committedAndPushed`, `commitFailed`,
`pushFailed`, `headAdvanced`, and `outcomeUnknown`.

Each step uses a fresh host operation ID and the existing Git writer lease,
process runner, authentication and event stream. Cancellation blocks dependent
parents while independent roots may continue under subsequent operation IDs.
A read-only cleanup deadline of five seconds reconciles a commit whose HEAD may
have advanced before cancellation. This command preserves the reconciled session
instead of replacing it with a generic late-cancellation envelope. Transport
errors before a continuation is returned must never be treated as success.
Retry re-inspects current state, preserves completed commits, and re-pushes
externally advanced completed branches before updating dependent parents.

Sessions own no background resources and are retained only for the current
workspace lifetime. Native clients discard old responses after workspace changes,
show confirmation/progress, and drive steps until `finished`. macOS uses this
shared workflow, as does Windows through its workspace-scoped continuation adapter
and real staging checkboxes. The native products must not duplicate planning or retry policy.
See `shared/fixtures/git/workspace-commit-v1.json` for primitive payloads and
`shared/fixtures/git/workspace-commit-workflow-v1.json` for the complete planning
and continuation fixture consumed by Rust, Swift, TypeScript and Tauri adapter tests.

### Decoded document text classification

`document.classifyText` accepts `{ text }` and returns `{ isPlainText }`.
The input is already decoded Unicode, independent of the filename, language ID,
or tokenizer availability. Core uses the same control-character policy as
`file.read`: reject U+0000–U+0008, U+000E–U+001F, and U+007F; allow other scalars,
including tabs, line breaks, form feed, Chinese, and emoji. The entire decoded
text is inspected, not an arbitrary byte prefix. A missing or non-string `text`
returns `invalid_request`. Hosts retain responsibility for size limits, I/O,
encoding selection, and decode failures; a permission or decode error must not
be relabeled as binary content.

The synchronous C ABI `lithe_core_is_plain_text(const uint8_t *, size_t)` borrows
UTF-8 bytes for the call, including embedded NUL, without allocating a JSON
copy. It returns `1` for plain text, `0` for binary control characters, and `-1`
for invalid UTF-8 or an invalid pointer/length combination. A zero-length input
is plain text and may use a null pointer. Nonzero input must point to at least
`length` readable bytes and `length` must not exceed `isize::MAX`. The Swift
bridge exposes the same lifetime and result contract. Fixtures live in
`shared/fixtures/editor/text-content-v1.json` and exercise both entry points.

## Local IDE capability broker

`ideHost.control` accepts `{action, arguments}` and delegates to the native

### Java service hot replacement

`debug.inspect` accepts the Java-provider extension `kind: "redefineClasses"`
with a caller-owned `operationId`. Unlike the inspection kinds, this operation
**mutates the running debuggee**; it requires a running or paused Java session,
but no selected thread. Platforms save documents and complete a successful JDT
`vscode.java.buildWorkspace` before submitting it. They must retain the original
launch target and compare its runtime paths with JDT before compiling; changed
paths require a restart instead of applying to a different output directory.

The terminal result is `{ kind: "redefineClasses", changedClasses: [...] }`,
sorted and deduplicated. Empty means no classes were replaced. Java Debug Server's
`errorMessage` inside a successful DAP response becomes `operationFailed` with
`adapterRejected`; the debug session remains usable. Malformed replacement
results also fail only the operation. Replacement does not imply continue.
The fixture is `shared/fixtures/debug/hot-code-replace-v1.json`.

Java debug launches append `-Dspring.devtools.restart.enabled=false` (also for
Core-planned direct JDT JDWP launches) so DevTools cannot restart the classloader during
HotSwap. Attach to independently launched JVMs does not change their options.
The Windows host maps `redefineClasses` to this operation and `cancelOperation`
to `debug.cancelOperation` with a `timedOut` reason for its bounded result wait.
