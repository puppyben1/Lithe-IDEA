# Application Boundary Contract

The application boundary describes product behavior that a SwiftUI/AppKit or
React/Tauri Windows UI can consume. It does not describe widgets, threads, processes,
or operating-system APIs. It defines the cross-platform contract; current
product scope and setup are documented in [`README.md`](../../README.md); the
verification scripts are the executable source of boundary checks.

## Data Rules

- All payloads are UTF-8 JSON when exchanged across a process or language boundary.
- Workspace paths are relative to the opened workspace and use `/` separators.
- Absolute paths may appear at native editor/process boundaries and as LSP/ACP
  `file://` resource URIs, but are not persisted as cross-platform identifiers.
- Product-facing line numbers are one-based. Editor/LSP positions explicitly use
  zero-based lines and UTF-16 columns. Missing locations are `null`.
- Lists have deterministic ordering so contract fixtures can be compared directly.
- Every asynchronous operation exposes `idle`, `loading`, `ready`, and `failed` outcomes.
- Failures contain a stable `code` and user-facing `message`; platform details belong in `details`.

## Feature Contracts

Shared Monaco highlighting is owned by the current view/model pair. A queued
callback for a closed or replaced model must finish without running against the
new model or locking surviving documents. Primary, split and diff views share
this lifecycle protection; actual symbol computation remains upstream-owned.

Agent prompt completion may include Agent-reported token counters; their accounting
scope belongs to the provider and is separate from context occupancy and subscription
quota. Platforms may measure locally observed turns with a monotonic clock, including
tools and permission waits, and freeze elapsed time at completion, failure or disconnect.
Normal Agent turns and permission decisions have no total-duration deadline. Quiet
activity notices are advisory and retain the busy turn; stop remains acknowledged
with bounded process cleanup. Missing usage and unmeasured replayed history remain
unknown. See the
[Agent host contract](rust-core-api.md) and `fixtures/agent/acp-events-v1.json`.

Agent activity presentation uses the selected session's reported plan, pending
tools and file diffs. Review acknowledgements are local to the exact reported
version; later edits remain reviewable and start after the acknowledged prefix.
The same open session retains its acknowledgements through disconnects and history
reloads; closing its tab releases them. Replay must still match the exact version
or prefix, so changed upstream evidence is never hidden by a stale acknowledgement.
Reported excerpts and missing original content are not full-file snapshots.
Native rollback is an explicit user action: preserve dirty editor buffers,
reject paths outside the workspace and ambiguous or incomplete evidence, retain
unrelated text, and use guarded native writes preserving encoding. Creation
requires explicit evidence before recoverable removal. Reject replacement terminal
symlinks instead of following them. Guard removal with the expected byte identity
and the native save lock; verify the actual moved object, restore it on conflict
without overwriting a recreated path, and report any manual recovery location.
Unsupported adapters must reject removal rather than use unchecked Trash.
Restoring a deletion
requires the path to remain absent. Batch failures retain unprocessed changes.
These presentation actions do not add Agent Host commands or persist chat history.

### Document encoding

Local text documents expose the selected encoding in the editor status bar. The
supported labels are `UTF-8`, `UTF-8 with BOM`, `GBK`, `GB18030`, `Shift JIS`,
and `Windows-1252`. Native adapters auto-detect UTF-8/BOM and the GBK family
when opening a file; an explicit reopen request decodes with the selected codec
and exposes replacement characters for invalid byte sequences. “Save
with Encoding” converts the current Unicode buffer only after the target codec
accepts every character. Both products preserve the raw-byte identity of the
last acknowledged disk snapshot and reject a save when another process changed
those bytes.

### External HTML preview

Both products open an existing local `.html` / `.htm` document in the system's
configured web browser, independently of the file type's default editor. The
browser reads the saved file; this action does not save buffers or start a web
server. File URLs preserve Unicode and reserved characters. Browser discovery
and launch belong to platform adapters, and launch failures are shown to the user.

## Module Lifecycle Contract

The macOS reference product implements the built-in manifest in
`shared/fixtures/modules/built-in-v1.json`. Module IDs and manifest fields are
platform-neutral compatibility surfaces. A future Windows implementation may
adopt the contract independently without sharing Swift implementation code or
being coupled to the macOS migration schedule. An implementation of this
contract must preserve these invariants:

- A disabled module is not instantiated and owns no task, timer, watcher,
  session, connection, or child process.
- An on-demand module is instantiated only after its capability is requested.
- Sleeping stops every owned resource and releases the module instance.
- Active non-interruptible work holds a lease that blocks sleep with a reason.
- Wake reconstructs the module, activates declared dependencies first, and
  republishes capabilities and contributions.
- Required modules cannot be disabled. A provider cannot be disabled while an
  enabled module depends on it.
- Module state is one of `disabled`, `inactive`, `activating`, `active`, `idle`,
  `preparingToSleep`, `sleeping`, `sleepBlocked`, or `failed`.
- Native plugin manifests, compatibility, ownership, and signatures are
  validated before Bundle loading. A failed optional package is reported to
  plugin management and does not prevent required modules from starting.
- Successfully loaded native plugin module IDs remain durably marked for the
  process lifetime. An unclean exit leaves the mark behind, so the next launch
  quarantines those modules before constructing any plugin Bundle. A clean
  application termination clears the mark.
- Disabling a loaded in-process native plugin stops its module-owned resources
  immediately. Its code remains mapped until restart, and the next launch
  skips the Bundle before invoking its principal class or factories.
- Plugin update, rollback, and uninstall operations that affect mapped code
  are finalized before plugin scanning on the next launch.
- Native plugin factories receive a read-only host context. Host services use
  stable IDs and shared protocols; plugin code cannot import a platform
  composition root or the application executable.
- AI Assistance, Agent Conversation, Terminal, Git, Search, Local History, Debug, and Java/Maven
  execution are built-in lifecycle modules. They are not marketplace plugins.
- Java language tooling remains part of the built-in product. Every other
  language provider is represented by an independently configurable bundled
  language-support plugin; PHP uses an optional separately installed native package,
  Go uses the bundled signed native-package path while the
  remaining providers share the host's generic language-server module.
- A downloadable language support package may declare language-server,
  execution, testing, and debug module IDs under one language ID. All referenced
  modules must be owned by the same package. Execution and testing may share a
  module when they share one toolchain lifecycle; language-server and debug
  lifecycles remain independently addressable.
- Plugin-owned Run and Test operations may reuse deterministic shared launch
  plans, but the actual child process must use a session owned by the plugin
  module. A disabled plugin language must not fall back to a built-in process
  provider.
- Process-backed language ownership comes from verified installed manifests,
  including packages that are disabled, quarantined, or failed to load. Those
  states make the capability unavailable; they never restore a host process
  fallback.
- Extension execution shutdown completes only after its operating-system
  process exits. A bounded force-stop failure remains visible as an active
  module resource. Active Run and Test sessions hold leases; successful LSP
  document synchronization refreshes the owning module's idle timer.
- Language package manifests include inert file-extension, file-name, and
  project-file recognition metadata. The host may use this metadata to suggest
  an uninstalled plugin, but it must not load the Bundle or probe a toolchain
  during recognition.

Platform products do not share module-runtime implementation code. The stable
manifest, lifecycle semantics, and deterministic JSON representation are the
portable boundary.

## Document Lifecycle Contract

An open document, rather than an editor widget, owns live text for the lifetime
of its tab. Recreating Monaco, `NSTextView`, syntax services, or an LSP binding
must reattach to that document and must not read an older memoized snapshot.

Persistence state is one of `clean`, `dirty`, `saving`, or `conflict`.
`saving` retains `operationId` and the immutable revision being written. A save
completion only clears dirty state when it still owns that operation and no
newer revision exists. A watcher may reload a clean document, but an external
change to a dirty document enters `conflict` and preserves live text until the
user chooses Keep Editor or Load Disk Version. Notifications during an in-flight
save are reconciled after its result. A missing file uses `diskConflict`, including
when the buffer was clean; it never silently clears the buffer or recreates the file.
Platforms own text and native I/O; Rust Core owns the deterministic decisions.

Local UTF-8 document saves carry the exact last-observed disk content (or an
explicitly acknowledged missing-file state) into a native guarded write. The
adapter compares bytes, stages a sibling file, checks again, and replaces the
target. A conflict does not write. Keep Editor acknowledges only the observed
version; another external edit must conflict again. Unsupported targets and I/O
errors fail closed. This narrows, but cannot eliminate, the race between the last
comparison and a write by an unrelated process.

Open document owners lease parent-directory observations independently of project
indexing. Windows routes events by window, document ID, and registration generation;
focus renews registrations and reconciles disk content. macOS provides document
observation through the native workspace file port. Closed or relocated documents
reject stale reads. The Windows frontend bounds concurrent reconciliation to four
per window; macOS runs native document I/O on a serial worker queue. Native local
filesystem calls do not promise a hard cancellation deadline. Remote/WSL and virtual
documents retain their separate adapters.

Windows native document failures expose a stable `code`, actionable `message`, and
platform `details`: `DOCUMENT_PERMISSION_DENIED`, `DOCUMENT_UNSUPPORTED`,
`DOCUMENT_INVALID_TEXT`, `DOCUMENT_IO_FAILED`, or `DOCUMENT_WORKER_FAILED`.
Watcher setup failures are logged and retried on focus; persistence remains guarded.

Workspace visibility and project detection exclude nested checkout containers
named `.worktree` or `.worktrees` by default, so a copied project is not treated
as a second set of sources or runnable services.

Process-backed features use the shared request fields `operationID` and
optional `timeoutMilliseconds`. Adapters emit lifecycle states `starting`,
`running`, `stopping`, `finished`, and `failed`; `operationID` lets the UI
ignore stale termination events after a restart. `stop()` is the cancellation
operation and must terminate the platform process without changing feature
state owned by another operation.

Java workspace activation is a shared Core decision over visible relative
paths. Any workspace containing a non-ignored `.java` source starts one JDT LS
session asynchronously, even without Maven or Gradle metadata. That session is
owned by the workspace and remains alive until the workspace closes or the user
explicitly restarts it. `ready` means JDT LS has completed project import, not
merely that the process answered `initialize`.

JDT LS runs only on the Temurin JDK 21 bundled with Lithe. This runtime is
independent of project Run/Debug JDK selection and has no user-configurable
path. A missing or invalid bundle is a packaging failure. The application shows
preparing, ready, failure, and timeout notifications; a navigation command while
preparing ends after the notice and is never replayed later.

macOS and Windows adapters discover the selected JDT LS installation's Equinox
launcher JAR, platform configuration directory, Lombok agent, Java Debug
Server, and bundled Java executable. Java Test-capable adapters additionally
submit ordered extension bundles; Rust Core owns their ordering and
de-duplication, the JVM flags, and direct `java`/`java.exe` startup with array
arguments. The macOS TestNG runner remains a packaged native resource used only
when a TestNG session starts. Packaged JDT LS therefore has no runtime dependency
on shell wrappers, PowerShell, or the user's `PATH`. Legacy wrappers are an
external-plan compatibility fallback and are not the packaged execution path.

Java test discovery remains a language-service workflow rather than a UI or
Debug Core parser. When the Tests tool window is opened or refreshed, the
language facade offers every Java source to Core's typed `javaTestItems`
operation; Core asks the Java Test extension for the class and method tree and
platforms project stable fully qualified identifiers into the native list.
Neither file names nor locally recognized annotations may prefilter this request,
so inherited tests and custom composed annotations remain visible. Closing the tool window, changing workspace, or reloading the
Java runtime cancels the owning discovery operation; late results cannot replace
the current workspace's tree. Discovery does not create a Debug session, result
socket, adapter connection, or target JVM.

Starting one JUnit or TestNG file, class, or method creates a short-lived native
loopback result listener on demand. JDT LS owns project/test metadata, Rust Core
owns deterministic DAP launch argument projection, and the Debug module owns the
adapter session. Repeated launch, stop, project close, runtime reload, and launch
failure all cancel the active operation and release the listener. The selected
Run configuration remains the source of project-scoped Java runtime selection;
JDT LS remains authoritative for the test runner classpath, working directory,
and test-specific VM and program arguments.

Platforms observe JDT LS version and non-recursive build-file metadata, while
Rust Core alone validates and reduces those observations to the opaque workspace
fingerprint. macOS and Windows adapters must not duplicate its ordering,
de-duplication, or serialization rules.

Editor changes use versioned incremental document synchronization and do not
restart the session or clear its index. Workspace watchers coalesce Maven and
Gradle changes before one project refresh and publish normalized watched-file
events. Platform adapters mark selected JDT LS caches as recently used, ask
Rust Core which inactive caches exceed the 30-day retention period, and delete
only those validated directories. **Java: Rebuild Index** remains the explicit
recovery path for the current workspace key.

Language feature clients route through a provider interface rather than
depending directly on an LSP session. Process-free providers remain available
when an executable is missing. LSP-backed features are enabled only after the
server advertises them during initialize or dynamic registration. The shared
core owns JSON-RPC state, stdio, process lifecycle, and normalized results;
platform adapters own executable and provider-resource discovery. Detailed
invariants are documented in
[`.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-13-language-tooling-and-lsp-runtime-ownership.md`](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-13-language-tooling-and-lsp-runtime-ownership.md).

Session lifecycle is a single discriminated state, never a set of booleans.
Capability negotiation is separately `unknown` or `known`; a known capability
is then supported or unsupported. Failures retain stable `code`, `stage`, exit
code, and diagnostic detail across the Rust, Swift, and TypeScript boundaries.
Domain and adapter layers return stable reasons rather than user-facing prose;
each product's presentation layer owns localized notification text.

Debugger stepping policy is portable. Rust Core owns adapter defaults,
normalization, validation, adapter launch projection, and the `isFiltered`
classification on normalized stack frames. Platform products own preference
persistence and decide whether matching consecutive frames are collapsed or
expanded in their native call-stack UI. No Debug session, adapter process, or
background task is created merely because stepping preferences exist.

Exception pause metadata is portable when the adapter advertises the standard
exception-information request. Rust Core normalizes the exception type,
description, break mode, stack trace, evaluation name, and nested details;
native products decide how that data is presented beside the current frame's
ordinary scopes and variables. An adapter that supplies no object reference
does not make the exception itself expandable through this contract.

Debugger variable paging is portable. Rust Core owns the standard DAP
`filter`, zero-based `start`, and positive `count` request projection and
normalizes adapter-reported `namedVariables` and `indexedVariables` counts to
non-negative values. Native products own tree expansion and page-size policy;
the macOS reference product loads at most 100 children per request, appends
named children before indexed children, exposes an in-tree load-more action,
and discards stale pages after the selected frame changes. A native client must
also stop offering more pages when an adapter returns more children than were
requested or repeats an already loaded page.

Debugger terminal launch ownership is split at the native boundary. Rust Core
advertises terminal support, validates and normalizes DAP `runInTerminal`
reverse requests, correlates the platform response, and rejects stale or
duplicate completions. The platform Terminal module owns PTY/ConPTY creation,
direct executable-and-argument startup, environment application, process IDs,
terminal presentation, and native termination. A Debug session is still lazy:
neither a terminal nor a debuggee process exists until an adapter requests one.

Debugger disconnect ownership is portable. A session started with `launch`
owns its local debuggee and sends `terminateDebuggee: true` when stopping. A
session started with `attach` does not own the remote JVM and sends
`terminateDebuggee: false`; closing the native transport must therefore detach
without killing the remote process. A session stopped before launch or attach
also uses the non-terminating policy.

For JDT LS, the standard initialize handshake and project-import readiness use
separate Core-owned deadlines. Project import fails only after 45 seconds
without changed progress or the 10-minute absolute safety cap; platform clients
must not impose a shorter readiness deadline. The terminal timeout code is
`serviceReadyTimeout`, and its details preserve the last import, download, and
cache snapshot for both products.

## Error Codes

Use stable categories rather than platform error strings:

- `invalid_request`
- `workspace_not_found`
- `permission_denied`
- `not_supported`
- `runtime_missing`
- `process_start_failed`
- `process_failed`
- `parse_failed`
- `cancelled`
- `timed_out`
- `unknown`

GitHub authorization is independent of a Lithe account. Device Flow is the
preferred path, and its token is stored only in the platform credential store.
The application boundary never exposes that token to a view or persistence
fixture. See [`github.md`](github.md).

## UI Boundary

The UI sends commands to an application feature model and renders state from
that model. It must not construct `Process`, file watchers, terminals, runtime
locators, Git command runners, or persistence stores. Platform-specific actions
such as directory picking, file-browser reveal, clipboard access, and native
shortcut monitoring are capability ports, not application logic.

## Workbench Background Contract

[`workbench-background-v1.schema.json`](workbench-background-v1.schema.json)
defines the portable background preference. It stores only a stable bundled
slot ID, `custom`, or `none`, plus opacity. A bundled slot is the same product
identifier on every platform; each product packages and renders its own copy of
that slot's image. `custom` deliberately contains no path, bookmark, token, or
image bytes. Native file access authorization and local-image metadata are
platform-private, so a preference can be understood on another platform
without leaking an unusable absolute path or macOS security-scoped bookmark.

Search and Git examples are kept in `shared/fixtures/`. New behavior should
add a fixture before adding a second platform implementation.

Git history clients load reference metadata independently from bounded commit
pages. The first page may load concurrently with references, but later pages
append through Core's opaque `nextCursor` while continuing the same bounded Git
log stream. Changing repositories or references and closing the history view
cancels the owning `operationID` and closes any retained cursor; a late result
cannot replace the active selection and its returned cursor is also closed.

Run configuration behavior is exposed through the `runConfig.*` commands.
Platform clients coordinate inspection, generation, resolution, typed document
edits, and launch planning, but must not implement a second JSON merger,
toolchain matcher, ID generator, argument parser, or Java/Maven argument
builder. Opening a project inspects existing files without writing; generation
is an explicit user action. Shared project overrides stay in
`.lithe/run/configurations.json`. Machine-local overrides may live in
`.lithe/run/local.json` or in a host-owned document supplied as
`localDocument`; absolute toolchain paths belong only in that local layer and
are excluded from project visibility and Git by default. Generic runtime
executables such as Node are selected in `.lithe/toolchains/local.json`; this
machine-local document is also excluded from Git by default. Missing or
incompatible toolchains block only configurations that consume the affected
toolchain, while diagnostics without a configuration ID apply to the project.
Runtime consumption is declared by the detector from the actual command rather
than inferred from the provider namespace. An automatically discovered runtime
path is session-effective: validation and launch share it, but persistence
still requires an explicit user selection.

Maven tool-window execution uses `maven.launchPlan`; platform views do not
assemble Maven arguments. Portable profile and Skip Tests defaults conform to
[`maven-portable-configuration-v1.schema.json`](maven-portable-configuration-v1.schema.json).
The transient Core request conforms to
[`maven-launch-context-v1.schema.json`](maven-launch-context-v1.schema.json).
External `settings.xml`, local repository, Maven executable, and Maven JDK
paths remain in a machine-local store. They may be supplied transiently to Core
for planning and fingerprinting, but Core never opens `settings.xml` or
serializes those paths into the portable project context.

Expanding a module's Dependencies node starts an on-demand query using
`maven.dependencyPlan`; Core owns the fixed plugin arguments and normalizes the
captured text through `maven.dependencies`. Each platform owns a separate,
bounded Maven process for this query so dependency loading cannot replace build
output or stop an ordinary Maven task. Results are cached by module until the
project or Maven configuration changes. The UI exposes loading, ready, failed,
and cancelled states, rejects stale results, and links every dependency to the
owning module's `pom.xml`. Dependency failure never blocks project loading or
Java editing.

The Java language-server startup consumes that same context. Core exposes the
selected `settings.xml` to JDT LS as
`java.configuration.maven.userSettings`, then applies the sorted Profile set
to the reactor and every recursively declared Maven module after JDT LS
reports `ServiceReady`. The Java session reaches `ready` at that verified
signal; Profile updates then run as a bounded background task with at most
eight in-flight projects. Each project reports its own result, and a rejected
or timed-out update preserves the usable Java session while exposing a partial
failure that the host can retry.

Maven-backed framework, test, and module launch planning consumes the current
project Maven context. A Run Configuration's explicit Profiles and toolchain
paths take precedence; explicit `cwd` and `extensions.maven.skipTests` values
also take precedence, including `skipTests: false`. Unset values inherit the
project settings. The shared Core applies the final Maven argument order;
tool-window, framework, test, and module launches add `-am` when reactor
dependencies must be built.

Project-owned Java Main and a Maven Spring Boot service with a resolved Java
entry source use a different boundary: the Java language service selects the
source target, Java Debug Server builds the owning project and resolves its
runtime classpath/module path, Core projects those structured paths into a
direct JDK launch, and the Run host starts that one JVM. Maven still defines the
project model, but Run never sends either target through a reactor-wide Java
launch goal. A Spring Boot service without a resolved Java entry source retains
its Maven-goal compatibility path. Run and Debug share the Java preparation path
so module selection, generated sources, test-source mains, and dependency paths
do not drift.

An unsuccessful Java launch build is evidence, not an unconditional host veto.
For `javaBuildCompilationErrors` and `javaBuildFailed`, the language boundary
still resolves the target's runtime paths and returns them with Core's build
report. Run and Debug pause the original attempt and offer Run Anyway, Always
Continue for this workspace, and Cancel; a reported index rebuild recovery also
offers Java: Rebuild Index. Continuing resumes the same attempt and never
issues a second build. Cancellation, timeout, transport failure, and an unknown
build status do not carry a code verdict and remain non-overridable. Build
elapsed time is displayed as evidence only, never used as a trust threshold.
Windows opens the Run tool window when a decision is required, including when
Debug was initiated from the Maven tool window, so no launch waits on an
unmounted prompt.

Java test actions use the same Maven process lifecycle for a complete JUnit 4
or JUnit 5 test class and for an individual method. The selector is validated
before launch and is passed through `maven.launchPlan`; no platform assembles a
shell command. Surefire/Failsafe text is normalized through `maven.testResults`
into passed, failed, skipped, and total counts plus ordered failure details.
When a stack frame resolves inside the workspace, the failure links to its
one-based source line. The active test operation owns cancellation and stop;
late output or parsed results cannot replace a newer run. The last valid class
or method selection remains available for an explicit rerun, while cancellation
clears only the active result.

Maven module menus use Core's resolved `extensions.maven.reactorPath` and
module identity before preferring a default Run configuration. An effective
working-directory override is not project ownership. File-dependent entries
such as Current File are not module launch candidates.

On Windows, Debug cleanup owns a Run execution ID in addition to its reusable
output slot. The host checks that ID atomically when stopping the process so a
late adapter shutdown cannot terminate a replacement Run in the same slot.

## SVG document preview

SVG extensions are matched case-insensitively and open as editable text in both
workspace and standalone file flows. The default presentation is editor plus
preview, with editor-only and preview-only modes available. All modes use the
same document buffer and preserve normal dirty, save, undo, and read-only rules.
Preview rendering uses the current unsaved source. Malformed source shows a
rendering failure while the editor remains accessible; correcting the source
restores the preview. SVG is rendered as image data, never inserted into the
application DOM as executable markup. Rendering and resizable layout are owned
by the platform. The behavior fixture is
[`svg-preview-v1.json`](../fixtures/editor/svg-preview-v1.json).

### Java project preparation presentation

Core projects the existing Java session, Maven profile task, and JDT build gate
into `projectPreparation` runtime events. Both products render this in their
status bar and Run panel, with language service settings and diagnostic access.
`starting`, `importing`, `configuring`, and `building` describe actual work;
`ready` describes preparation completion, not successful compilation or a valid
launch configuration. Ordinary indexing is not a run prerequisite.

Preparation is scoped to the Java workspace session. Only JDT-backed launch
paths honor `blocksRun`; other language and Maven-goal launchers keep their own
prerequisites. Partial profile failures remain visible without blocking unrelated
modules: the target build still validates its own readiness. Consumers reject old
session updates and clear state on explicit stop/workspace replacement.
Core's bounded preparation wait is the single launch gate; platform services and
Run controls do not race it with a second snapshot check. Preparation remains
visible while a click queues behind Core, and a stale visible `ready` state
cannot disagree with a separate host-owned preparation veto.

### Optional PHP support

PHP plugin installation is explicit. The base application ships neither the PHP
native package nor Node/Bun/Intelephense. macOS accepts a verified signed package
through plugin management; its tools are user-owned and never deleted by Lithe.
Windows installs language tools only on an explicit install/repair action; its
managed tool cache is removed on uninstall without touching global tools. PHP
run/test discovery and launch require enabled support. Disable cancels installation,
stops in-flight and active owned processes, and unregisters providers; closing a
workspace stops that workspace's PHP Run sessions. Shared lexical PHP recognition
may remain available without spawning processes or downloading dependencies.

Windows optional language implementations are single-module worker packages
(`lithe-worker-plugin`, format version 1). PHP configuration and Composer/PHPUnit
plan generation live in `Plugins/win/Official/PhpSupport`; application builds must
not import that implementation, even through a dynamic import. The inert optional
language catalog may identify package ownership without carrying executable code.

A user imports a `.lithe-extension` file through extension management. The package
contains a validated manifest and ESM source (maximum 256 KiB), stored atomically in
the WebView user profile under `lithe.worker-package:<id>`. Import installs language
tools but leaves the plugin disabled; enabling starts the existing worker host.
Incomplete installation is not restored on restart. Uninstall removes the source,
parser cache and owned tools; the application installation directory stays read-only.
Local packages are user-selected code, not authenticated official downloads.

The v1 language package accepts `languages`, `lsp`, and `runActions` declarations;
other host permissions and contributions are not granted. `lsp.requiredExecutables`
is passed to the native tool adapter for PATH validation. `runActions.manifestFiles`
contains at most 16 root-level file names; `executables` names allowed PATH commands.
The worker's `api.runActions.register` receives file contents and returns bounded
plans (`id`, `name`, `sourceLabel`, optional `description`, `executable`, `arguments`).
Only a user click launches a validated plan through the host Run service after saving
the workspace. Workers never own the native process handles; the host tracks both
extension ID and workspace ID, stops pending and active runs on disable/close, and
rejects stale discovery results. Remote/WSL projects do not use these local plans.

## Text content and language selection

Native adapters decode document bytes using the existing encoding catalog.
Decoded content is classified by Core's `document.classifyText` policy, also
available through its borrowed UTF-8 C ABI. File extensions and installed
language contributions must not exempt text from control-character validation
or cause Unicode text to be classified as binary. Windows opening and session
restoration share one content loader; read failures remain actionable errors.
Explicit image, database, PDF, and binary-format viewers retain their host routing.

Both Monaco hosts use the bundled INI tokenizer for `.properties`. Tokenization
is presentation only: no grammar or language server is required to open plain
text. Register bundled contributions in `frontend/editor`, not in a separate
platform-specific tokenizer. Text fixtures are shared under
`shared/fixtures/editor/text-content-v1.json`.

### Updating a running Java service

Run/Debug presentation owns an explicit update action bound to an execution ID,
not the latest Run configuration or focused editor. Platform workflows save the
workspace, reuse the live JDT session to verify the original runtime paths, and
compile with the existing Core build coordinator. Build failures cannot be
bypassed for updates. Core owns Java Debug Server response normalization; hosts
own deadlines, stale-result rejection, UI progress and explicit restart actions.

Run offers compilation for executions whose launch classpath includes Spring
Boot DevTools. Compilation completion does not establish restart or readiness;
the UI directs users to service output, and respects a project-configured trigger
file. Debug uses HotSwap with DevTools automatic restart disabled at JVM launch.
Remote attach and non-JDT launches have no update action in this first version.
No installed resources or new runtime caches are written: output remains in
JDT-owned workspace build paths and the existing platform-owned JDT state.

### Agent 响应状态展示

- 状态与已观察到的 ACP 进度一致：准备会话、等待响应、收到推理、收到回复、本轮工具执行、等待授权、明确重试和正在停止。静默时长不能证明正在推理或重试，已回放的历史工具不属于当前轮次。
- 固定 codex-acp 的 `session_info_update._meta.codex.error.willRetry == true` 和非空 `turnId` 是 macOS 重试显示的证据；该通知可能没有 `title`。共享样例 `codexRetry` 由官方 ACP SDK 往返验证，Host 继续透传元数据，不新增请求/事件种类或网络重试策略。
- 状态隔离到会话，新进度清除重试显示，完成/失败/断连清理本轮状态，正在停止时不因迟到进度回退；不得显示未经脱敏的原始错误或从文本猜测重试次数。请求仍等待上游完成/取消确认，既有十分钟 prompt 上限和十秒取消上限不变。
- 这次交付 macOS 展示；Windows 对话 UI 的消费与真实验收仍待完成。展示状态只在内存中，不写入 bundle、安装目录或上游历史。
